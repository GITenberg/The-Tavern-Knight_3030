    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. ON THE MARCH
    </h2>
    <p>
      He whom they called the Tavern Knight laughed an evil laugh&mdash;such a
      laugh as might fall from the lips of Satan in a sardonic moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat within the halo of yellow light shed by two tallow candles, whose
      sconces were two empty bottles, and contemptuously he eyed the youth in
      black, standing with white face and quivering lip in a corner of the mean
      chamber. Then he laughed again, and in a hoarse voice, sorely suggestive
      of the bottle, he broke into song. He lay back in his chair, his long,
      spare legs outstretched, his spurs jingling to the lilt of his ditty whose
      burden ran:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          On the lip so red of the wench that's sped
          His passionate kiss burns, still-O!
          For 'tis April time, and of love and wine
          Youth's way is to take its fill-O!
          Down, down, derry-do!

          So his cup he drains and he shakes his reins,
          And rides his rake-helly way-O!
          She was sweet to woo and most comely, too,
          But that was all yesterday-O!
          Down, down, derry-do!
</pre>
    <p>
      The lad started forward with something akin to a shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have done,&rdquo; he cried, in a voice of loathing, &ldquo;or, if croak you must,
      choose a ditty less foul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; The ruffler shook back the matted hair from his lean, harsh face,
      and a pair of eyes that of a sudden seemed ablaze glared at his companion;
      then the lids drooped until those eyes became two narrow slits&mdash;catlike
      and cunning&mdash;and again he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad's life, Master Stewart, you have a temerity that should save you from
      grey hairs! What is't to you what ditty my fancy seizes on? 'Swounds, man,
      for three weary months have I curbed my moods, and worn my throat dry in
      praising the Lord; for three months have I been a living monument of
      Covenanting zeal and godliness; and now that at last I have shaken the
      dust of your beggarly Scotland from my heels, you&mdash;the veriest
      milksop that ever ran tottering from its mother's lap would chide me
      because, yon bottle being done, I sing to keep me from waxing sad in the
      contemplation of its emptiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was scorn unutterable on the lad's face as he turned aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I joined Middleton's horse and accepted service under you, I held
      you to be at least a gentleman,&rdquo; was his daring rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant that dangerous light gleamed again from his companion's
      eye. Then, as before, the lids drooped, and, as before, he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentleman!&rdquo; he mocked. &ldquo;On my soul, that's good! And what may you know of
      gentlemen, Sir Scot? Think you a gentleman is a Jack Presbyter, or a
      droning member of your kirk committee, strutting it like a crow in the
      gutter? Gadswounds, boy, when I was your age, and George Villiers lived&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, have done!&rdquo; broke in the youth impetuously. &ldquo;Suffer me to leave you,
      Sir Crispin, to your bottle, your croaking, and your memories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, go your ways, sir; you'd be sorry company for a dead man&mdash;the
      sorriest ever my evil star led me into. The door is yonder, and should you
      chance to break your saintly neck on the stairs, it is like to be well for
      both of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that Sir Crispin Galliard lay back in his chair once more, and
      took up the thread of his interrupted song
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          But, heigh-o! she cried, at the Christmas-tide,
          That dead she would rather be-O!
          Pale and wan she crept out of sight, and wept

          'Tis a sorry&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      A loud knock that echoed ominously through the mean chamber, fell in that
      instant upon the door. And with it came a panting cry of&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open, Cris! Open, for the love of God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Crispin's ballad broke off short, whilst the lad paused in the act of
      quitting the room, and turned to look to him for direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my master,&rdquo; quoth Galliard, &ldquo;for what do you wait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To learn your wishes, sir,&rdquo; was the answer sullenly delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wishes! Rat me, there's one without whose wishes brook less waiting!
      Open, fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus rudely enjoined, the lad lifted the latch and set wide the door,
      which opened immediately upon the street. Into the apartment stumbled a
      roughly clad man of huge frame. He was breathing hard, and fear was writ
      large upon his rugged face. An instant he paused to close the door after
      him, then turning to Galliard, who had risen and who stood eyeing him in
      astonishment&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hide me somewhere, Cris,&rdquo; he panted&mdash;his accent proclaiming his
      Irish origin. &ldquo;My God, hide me, or I'm a dead man this night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Slife, Hogan! What is toward? Has Cromwell overtaken us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cromwell, quotha? Would to Heaven 'twere no worse! I've killed a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he's dead, why run?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Irishman made an impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A party of Montgomery's foot is on my heels. They've raised the whole of
      Penrith over the affair, and if I'm taken, soul of my body, 'twill be a
      short shrift they'll give me. The King will serve me as poor Wrycraft was
      served two days ago at Kendal. Mother of Mercy!&rdquo; he broke off, as his ear
      caught the clatter of feet and the murmur of voices from without. &ldquo;Have
      you a hole I can creep into?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up those stairs and into my room with you!&rdquo; said Crispin shortly. &ldquo;I will
      try to head them off. Come, man, stir yourself; they are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as with nimble alacrity Hogan obeyed him and slipped from the room,
      he turned to the lad, who had been a silent spectator of what had passed.
      From the pocket of his threadbare doublet he drew a pack of greasy playing
      cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To table,&rdquo; he said laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boy, comprehending what was required of him, drew back at sight of
      those cards as one might shrink from a thing unclean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I'll not defile&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To table, fool!&rdquo; thundered Crispin, with a vehemence few men could have
      withstood. &ldquo;Is this a time for Presbyterian scruples? To table, and help a
      me play this game, or, by the living God, I'll&mdash;&rdquo; Without completing
      his threat he leaned forward until Kenneth felt his hot, wine-laden breath
      upon his cheek. Cowed by his words, his gesture, and above all, his
      glance, the lad drew up a chair, mumbling in explanation&mdash;intended as
      an excuse to himself for his weakness&mdash;that he submitted since a
      man's life was at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite him Galliard resumed his seat with a mocking smile that made him
      wince. Taking up the cards, he flung a portion of them to the boy, whilst
      those he retained he spread fanwise in his hand as if about to play.
      Silently Kenneth copied his actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearer and louder grew the sounds of the approach, lights flashed before
      the window, and the two men, feigning to play, sat on and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a care, Master Stewart,&rdquo; growled Crispin sourly, then in a louder
      voice&mdash;for his quick eye had caught a glimpse of a face that watched
      them from the window&mdash;&ldquo;I play the King of Spades!&rdquo; he cried, with
      meaning look.
    </p>
    <p>
      A blow was struck upon the door, and with it came the command to &ldquo;Open in
      the King's name!&rdquo; Softly Sir Crispin rapped out an oath. Then he rose, and
      with a last look of warning to Kenneth, he went to open. And as he had
      greeted Hogan he now greeted the crowd mainly of soldiers&mdash;that
      surged about the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sirs, why this ado? Hath the Sultan Oliver descended upon us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In one hand he still held his cards, the other he rested upon the edge of
      the open door. It was a young ensign who stood forward to answer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of Lord Middleton's officers hath done a man to death not half an
      hour agone; he is an Irishman Captain Hogan by name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogan&mdash;Hogan?&rdquo; repeated Crispin, after the manner of one who fumbles
      in his memory. &ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;an Irishman with a grey head and a hot
      temper. And he is dead, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, he has done the killing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I can better understand. 'Tis not the first time, I'll be sworn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it will be the last, Sir Crispin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like enough. The King is severe since we crossed the Border.&rdquo; Then in a
      brisker tone: &ldquo;I thank you for bringing me this news,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I
      regret that in my poor house there be naught I can offer you wherein to
      drink His Majesty's health ere you proceed upon your search. Give you good
      night, sir.&rdquo; And by drawing back a pace he signified his wish to close the
      door and be quit of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We thought,&rdquo; faltered the young officer, &ldquo;that&mdash;that perchance you
      would assist us by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assist you!&rdquo; roared Crispin, with a fine assumption of anger. &ldquo;Assist you
      take a man? Sink me, sir, I would have you know I am a soldier, not a
      tipstaff!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ensign's cheeks grew crimson under the sting of that veiled insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some, Sir Crispin, that have yet another name for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like enough&mdash;when I am not by,&rdquo; sneered Crispin. &ldquo;The world is full
      of foul tongues in craven heads. But, sirs, the night air is chill and you
      are come inopportunely, for, as you'll perceive, I was at play. Haply
      you'll suffer me to close the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A moment, Sir Crispin. We must search this house. He is believed to have
      come this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin yawned. &ldquo;I will spare you the trouble. You may take it from me
      that he could not be here without my knowledge. I have been in this room
      these two hours past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twill not suffice,&rdquo; returned the officer doggedly. &ldquo;We must satisfy
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satisfy yourselves?&rdquo; echoed the other, in tones of deep amazement. &ldquo;What
      better satisfaction can I afford you than my word? 'Swounds, sir
      jackanapes,&rdquo; he added, in a roar that sent the lieutenant back a pace as
      though he had been struck, &ldquo;am I to take it that your errand is a
      trumped-up business to affront me? First you invite me to turn tipstaff,
      then you add your cursed innuendoes of what people say of me, and now you
      end by doubting me! You must satisfy yourself!&rdquo; he thundered, waxing
      fiercer at every word. &ldquo;Linger another moment on that threshold, and d&mdash;&mdash;n
      me, sir, I'll give you satisfaction of another flavour! Be off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before that hurricane of passion the ensign recoiled, despite himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will appeal to General Montgomery,&rdquo; he threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Appeal to the devil! Had you come hither with your errand in a seemly
      fashion you had found my door thrown wide in welcome, and I had received
      you courteously. As it is, sir, the cause for complaint is on my side, and
      complain I will. We shall see whether the King permits an old soldier who
      has followed the fortunes of his family these eighteen years to be flouted
      by a malapert bantam of yesterday's brood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The subaltern paused in dismay. Some demur there was in the gathered
      crowd. Then the officer fell back a pace, and consulted an elderly trooper
      at his elbow. The trooper was of opinion that the fugitive must have gone
      farther. Moreover, he could not think, from what Sir Crispin had said,
      that it would have been possible for Hogan to have entered the house. With
      this, and realizing that much trouble and possible loss of time must
      result from Sir Crispin's obstinacy, did they attempt to force a way into
      the house, and bethinking himself, also, maybe, how well this rascally
      ruffler stood with Lord Middleton, the ensign determined to withdraw, and
      to seek elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he took his leave with a venomous glance, and a parting threat to
      bring the matter to the King's ears, upon which Galliard slammed the door
      before he had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a curious smile on Crispin's face as he walked slowly to the
      table, and resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Stewart,&rdquo; he whispered, as he spread his cards anew, &ldquo;the comedy
      is not yet played out. There is a face glued to the window at this moment,
      and I make little doubt that for the next hour or so we shall be spied
      upon. That pretty fellow was born to be a thief-taker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy turned a glance of sour reproof upon his companion. He had not
      stirred from his chair while Crispin had been at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lied to them,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! Not so loud, sweet youth,&rdquo; was the answer that lost nothing of menace
      by being subdued. &ldquo;Tomorrow, if you please, I will account to you for
      offending your delicate soul by suggesting a falsehood in your presence.
      To-night we have a man's life to save, and that, I think, is work enough.
      Come, Master Stewart, we are being watched. Let us resume our game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eye, fixed in cold command upon the boy, compelled obedience. And the
      lad, more out of awe of that glance than out of any desire to contribute
      to the saving of Hogan, mutely consented to keep up this pretence. But in
      his soul he rebelled. He had been reared in an atmosphere of honourable
      and religious bigotry. Hogan was to him a coarse ruffler; an evil man of
      the sword; such a man as he abhorred and accounted a disgrace to any army&mdash;particularly
      to an army launched upon England under the auspices of the Solemn League
      and Covenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogan had been guilty of an act of brutality; he had killed a man; and
      Kenneth deemed himself little better, since he assisted in harbouring
      instead of discovering him, as he held to be his duty. But 'neath the
      suasion of Galliard's inexorable eye he sat limp and docile, vowing to
      himself that on the morrow he would lay the matter before Lord Middleton,
      and thus not only endeavour to make amends for his present guilty silence,
      but rid himself also of the companionship of this ruffianly Sir Crispin,
      to whom no doubt a hempen justice would be meted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, he sat on and left his companion's occasional sallies
      unanswered. In the street men stirred and lanthorns gleamed fitfully,
      whilst ever and anon a face surmounted by a morion would be pressed
      against the leaded panes of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus an hour wore itself out during which poor Hogan sat above, alone with
      his anxiety and unsavoury thoughts.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. ARCADES AMBO
    </h2>
    <p>
      Towards midnight at last Sir Crispin flung down his cards and rose. It was
      close upon an hour and a half since Hogan's advent. In the streets the
      sounds had gradually died down, and peace seemed to reign again in
      Penrith. Yet was Sir Crispin cautious&mdash;for to be cautious and
      mistrustful of appearances was the lesson life had taught him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Stewart,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it grows late, and I doubt me you would be
      abed. Give you good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lad rose. A moment he paused, hesitating, then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, Sir Crispin&mdash;&rdquo; he began. But Crispin cut him short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave to-morrow till it dawn, my friend. Give you good night. Take one of
      those noisome tapers with you, and go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In sullen silence the boy took up one of the candle-bearing bottles and
      passed out through the door leading to the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Crispin remained standing by the table, and in that moment
      the expression of his face was softened. A momentary regret of his
      treatment of the boy stirred in him. Master Stewart might be a milksop,
      but Crispin accounted him leastways honest, and had a kindness for him in
      spite of all. He crossed to the window, and throwing it wide he leaned
      out, as if to breathe the cool night air, what time he hummed the refrain
      of `Rub-a-dub-dub' for the edification of any chance listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a half-hour he lingered there, and for all that he used the occasion
      to let his mind stray over many a theme, his eyes were alert for the least
      movement among the shadows of the street. Reassured at last that the house
      was no longer being watched, he drew back, and closed the lattice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs he found the Irishman seated in dejection upon his bed, awaiting
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soul of my body!&rdquo; cried Hogan ruefully, &ldquo;I was never nearer being afraid
      in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin laughed softly for answer, and besought of him the tale of what
      had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis simple enough, faith,&rdquo; said Hogan coolly. &ldquo;The landlord of The Angel
      hath a daughter maybe 'twas after her he named his inn&mdash;who owns a
      pair of the most seductive eyes that ever a man saw perdition in. She
      hath, moreover, a taste for dalliance, and my brave looks and martial
      trappings did for her what her bold eyes had done for me. We were becoming
      the sweetest friends, when, like an incarnate fiend, that loutish clown,
      her lover, sweeps down upon us, and, with more jealousy than wit, struck
      me&mdash;struck me, Harry Hogan! Soul of my body, think of it, Cris!&rdquo; And
      he grew red with anger at the recollection. &ldquo;I took him by the collar of
      his mean smock and flung him into the kennel&mdash;the fittest bed he ever
      lay in. Had he remained there it had been well for him; but the fool,
      accounting himself affronted, came up to demand satisfaction. I gave it
      him, and plague on it&mdash;he's dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An ugly tale,&rdquo; was Crispin's sour comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugly, maybe,&rdquo; returned Hogan, spreading out his palms, &ldquo;but what choice
      had I? The fool came at me, bilbo in hand, and I was forced to draw.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not to slay, Hogan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twas an accident. Sink me, it was! I sought his sword-arm; but the light
      was bad, and my point went through his chest instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Crispin stood frowning, then his brow cleared, as though he
      had put the matter from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well&mdash;since he's dead, there's an end to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven rest his soul!&rdquo; muttered the Irishman, crossing himself piously.
      And with that he dismissed the subject of the great wrong that through
      folly he had wrought&mdash;the wanton destruction of a man's life, and the
      poisoning of a woman's with a remorse that might be everlasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will tax our wits to get you out of Penrith,&rdquo; said Crispin. Then,
      turning and looking into the Irishman's great, good-humoured face&mdash;&ldquo;I
      am sorry you leave us, Hogan,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so am I,&rdquo; quoth Hogan with a shrug. &ldquo;Such a march as this is little
      to my taste. Bah! Charles Stuart or Oliver Cromwell, 'tis all one to me.
      What care I whether King or Commonwealth prevail? Shall Harry Hogan be the
      better or the richer under one than under the other? Oddslife, Cris, I
      have trailed a pike or handled a sword in well-nigh every army in Europe.
      I know more of the great art of war than all the King's generals rolled
      into one. Think you, then, I can rest content with a miserable company of
      horse when plunder is forbidden, and even our beggarly pay doubtful?
      Whilst, should things go ill&mdash;as well they may, faith, with an army
      ruled by parsons&mdash;the wage will be a swift death on field or gallows,
      or a lingering one in the plantations, as fell to the lot of those poor
      wretches Noll drove into England after Dunbar. Soul of my body, it is not
      thus that I had looked to fare when I took service at Perth. I had looked
      for plunder, rich and plentiful plunder, according to the usages of
      warfare, as a fitting reward for a toilsome march and the perils gone
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus I know war, and for this have I followed the trade these twenty
      years. Instead, we have thirty thousand men, marching to battle as prim
      and orderly as a parcel of acolytes in a Corpus-Christi procession. 'Twas
      not so bad in Scotland haply because the country holds naught a man may
      profitably plunder&mdash;but since we have crossed the Border, 'slife,
      they'll hang you if you steal so much as a kiss from a wench in passing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, true,&rdquo; laughed Crispin, &ldquo;the Second Charles hath an over-tender
      stomach. He will not allow that we are marching through an enemy's
      country; he insists that England is his kingdom, forgetting that he has
      yet to conquer it, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it not also his father's kingdom?&rdquo; broke in the impetuous Hogan. &ldquo;Yet
      times are sorely changed since we followed the fortunes of the Martyr. In
      those days you might help yourself to a capon, a horse, a wench, or any
      other trifle of the enemy's, without ever a word of censure or a question
      asked. Why, man, it is but two days since His Majesty had a poor devil
      hanged at Kendal for laying violent hands upon a pullet. Pox on it, Cris,
      my gorge rises at the thought! When I saw that wretch strung up, I swore
      to fall behind at the earliest opportunity, and to-night's affair makes
      this imperative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what may your plans be?&rdquo; asked Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War is my trade, not a diversion, as it is with Wilmot and Buckingham and
      the other pretty gentlemen of our train. And since the King's army is like
      to yield me no profit, faith, I'll turn me to the Parliament's. If I get
      out of Penrith with my life, I'll shave my beard and cut my hair to a
      comely and godly length; don a cuckoldy steeple hat and a black coat, and
      carry my sword to Cromwell with a line of text.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Crispin fell to pondering. Noting this, and imagining that he guessed
      aright the reason:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it, Cris,&rdquo; he put in, keenly glancing at the other, &ldquo;that you are
      much of my mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I am,&rdquo; replied Crispin carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; cried Hogan, &ldquo;need we part company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden eagerness in his tone, born of the admiration in which
      this rough soldier of fortune held one whom he accounted his better in
      that same harsh trade. But Galliard answered coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so! Surely on Cromwell's side your object&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T'sh! I have well considered. My fortunes are bound up with the King's.
      In his victory alone lies profit for me; not the profit of pillage, Hogan,
      but the profit of those broad lands that for nigh upon twenty years have
      been in usurping hands. The profit I look for, Hogan, is my restoration to
      Castle Marleigh, and of this my only hope lies in the restoration of King
      Charles. If the King doth not prevail&mdash;which God forfend!&mdash;why,
      then, I can but die. I shall have naught left to hope for from life. So
      you see, good Hogan,&rdquo; he ended with a regretful smile, &ldquo;my going with you
      is not to be dreamed of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still the Irishman urged him, and a good half-hour did he devote to it,
      but in vain. Realizing at last the futility of his endeavours, he sighed
      and moved uneasily in his chair, whilst the broad, tanned face was clouded
      with regret. Crispin saw this, and approaching him, he laid a hand upon
      his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had counted upon your help to clear the Ashburns from Castle Marleigh
      and to aid me in my grim work when the time is ripe. But if you go&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I may aid you yet. Who shall say?&rdquo; Then of a sudden there crept
      into the voice of this hardened pike-trader a note of soft concern. &ldquo;Think
      you there be danger to yourself in remaining?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Danger? To me?&rdquo; echoed Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye&mdash;for having harboured me. That whelp of Montgomery's Foot
      suspects you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspects? Am I a man of straw to be overset by a breath of suspicion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is your lieutenant, Kenneth Stewart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has been a party to your escape, and whose only course is therefore
      silence, lest he set a noose about his own neck. Come, Harry,&rdquo; he added,
      briskly, changing his manner, &ldquo;the night wears on, and we have your safety
      to think of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan rose with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a horse,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and by God's grace tomorrow shall find me in
      Cromwell's camp. Heaven prosper and reward you, Cris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must find you clothes more fitting than these&mdash;a coat more staid
      and better attuned to the Puritan part you are to play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you such a coat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lieutenant has. He affects the godly black, from a habit taken in that
      Presbyterian Scotland of his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am twice his bulk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better a tight coat to your back than a tight rope to your neck, Harry.
      Wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking a taper, he left the room, to return a moment later with the coat
      that Kenneth had worn that day, and which he had abstracted from the
      sleeping lad's chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off with your doublet,&rdquo; he commanded, and as he spoke he set himself to
      empty the pocket of Kenneth's garment; a handkerchief and a few papers he
      found in them, and these he tossed carelessly on the bed. Next he assisted
      the Irishman to struggle into the stolen coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May the Lord forgive my sins,&rdquo; groaned Hogan, as he felt the cloth
      straining upon his back and cramping his limbs. &ldquo;May He forgive me, and
      see me safely out of Penrith and into Cromwell's camp, and never again
      will I resent the resentment of a clown whose sweetheart I have made too
      free with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pluck that feather from your hat,&rdquo; said Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogan obeyed him with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly it is written in Scripture that man in his time plays many parts.
      Who would have thought to see Harry Hogan playing the Puritan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless you improve your acquaintance with Scripture you are not like to
      play it long,&rdquo; laughed Crispin, as he surveyed him. &ldquo;There, man, you'll do
      well enough. Your coat is somewhat tight in the back, somewhat short in
      the skirt; but neither so tight nor so short but that it may be preferred
      to a winding-sheet, and that is the alternative, Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan replied by roundly cursing the coat and his own lucklessness. That
      done&mdash;and in no measured terms&mdash;he pronounced himself ready to
      set out, whereupon Crispin led the way below once more, and out into a hut
      that did service as a stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the light of a lanthorn he saddled one of the two nags that stood
      there, and led it into the yard. Opening the door that abutted on to a
      field beyond, he bade Hogan mount. He held his stirrup for him, and
      cutting short the Irishman's voluble expressions of gratitude, he gave him
      &ldquo;God speed,&rdquo; and urged him to use all dispatch in setting as great a
      distance as possible betwixt himself and Penrith before the dawn.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. THE LETTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was with a countenance sadly dejected that Crispin returned to his
      chamber and sate himself wearily upon the bed. With elbows on his knees
      and chin in his palms he stared straight before him, the usual steely
      brightness of his grey eyes dulled by the despondency that sat upon his
      face and drew deep furrows down his fine brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sigh he rose at last and idly fingered the papers he had taken from
      the pocket of Kenneth's coat. As he did so his glance was arrested by the
      signature at the foot of one. &ldquo;Gregory Ashburn&rdquo; was the name he read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ashen grew his cheeks as his eyes fastened upon that name, whilst the
      hand, to which no peril ever brought a tremor, shook now like an aspen.
      Feverishly he spread the letter on his knee, and with a glance, from dull
      that it had been, grown of a sudden fierce and cruel, he read the
      contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR KENNETH,
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I write in the hope that I may prevail upon you to quit Scotland and
      your attachment to a king, whose fortunes prosper not, nor can prosper.
      Cynthia is pining, and if you tarry longer from Castle Marleigh she must
      perforce think you but a laggard lover. Than this I have no more powerful
      argument wherewith to draw you from Perth to Sheringham, but this I think
      should prevail where others have failed me. We await you then, and whilst
      we wait we daily drink your health. Cynthia commends herself to your
      memory as doth my brother, and soon we hope to welcome you at Castle
      Marleigh. Believe, my dear Kenneth, that whilst I am, I am yours in
      affection.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                             GREGORY ASHBURN
</pre>
    <p>
      Twice Crispin read the letter through. Then with set teeth and straining
      eyes he sat lost in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here indeed was a strange chance! This boy whom he had met at Perth, and
      enrolled in his company, was a friend of Ashburn's&mdash;the lover of
      Cynthia. Who might this Cynthia be?
    </p>
    <p>
      Long and deep were his ponderings upon the unfathomable ways of Fate&mdash;for
      Fate he now believed was here at work to help him, revealing herself by
      means of this sign even at the very moment when he decried his luck. In
      memory he reviewed his meeting with the lad in the yard of Perth Castle a
      fortnight ago. Something in the boy's bearing, in his air, had caught
      Crispin's eye. He had looked him over, then approached, and bluntly asked
      his name and on what business he was come there. The youth had answered
      him civilly enough that he was Kenneth Stewart of Bailienochy, and that he
      was come to offer his sword to the King. Thereupon he had interested
      himself in the lad's behalf and had gained him a lieutenancy in his own
      company. Why he was attracted to a youth on whom never before had he set
      eyes was a matter that puzzled him not a little. Now he held, he thought,
      the explanation of it. It was the way of Fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      This boy was sent into his life by a Heaven that at last showed compassion
      for the deep wrongs he had suffered; sent him as a key wherewith, should
      the need occur, to open him the gates of Castle Marleigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      In long strides he paced the chamber, turning the matter over in his mind.
      Aye, he would use the lad should the need arise. Why scruple? Had he ever
      received aught but disdain and scorn at the hands of Kenneth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day was breaking ere he sought his bed, and already the sun was up when at
      length he fell into a troubled sleep, vowing that he would mend his wild
      ways and seek to gain the boy's favour against the time when he might have
      need of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When later he restored the papers to Kenneth, explaining to what use he
      had put the coat, he refrained from questioning him concerning Gregory
      Ashburn. The docility of his mood on that occasion came as a surprise to
      Kenneth, who set it down to Sir Crispin's desire to conciliate him into
      silence touching the harbouring of Hogan. In that same connexion Crispin
      showed him calmly and clearly that he could not now inform without
      involving himself to an equally dangerous extent. And partly through the
      fear of this, partly won over by Crispin's persuasions, the lad determined
      to hold his peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor had he cause to regret it thereafter, for throughout that tedious
      march he found his roystering companion singularly meek and kindly. Indeed
      he seemed a different man. His old swagger and roaring bluster
      disappeared; he drank less, diced less, blasphemed less, and stormed less
      than in the old days before the halt at Penrith; but rode, a silent,
      thoughtful figure, so self-contained and of so godly a mien as would have
      rejoiced the heart of the sourest Puritan. The wild tantivy boy had
      vanished, and the sobriquet of &ldquo;Tavern Knight&rdquo; was fast becoming a
      misnomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth felt drawn more towards him, deeming him a penitent that had seen
      at last the error of his ways. And thus things prevailed until the almost
      triumphal entry into the city of Worcester on the twenty-third of August.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. AT THE SIGN OF THE MITRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a week after the coming of the King to Worcester, Crispin's relations
      with Kenneth steadily improved. By an evil chance, however, there befell
      on the eve of the battle that which renewed with heightened intensity the
      enmity which the lad had fostered for him, but which lately he had almost
      overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene of this happening&mdash;leastways of that which led to it&mdash;was
      The Mitre Inn, in the High Street of Worcester.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the common-room one day sat as merry a company of carousers as ever
      gladdened the soul of an old tantivy boy. Youthful ensigns of Lesley's
      Scottish horse&mdash;caring never a fig for the Solemn League and Covenant&mdash;rubbed
      shoulders with beribboned Cavaliers of Lord Talbot's company; gay young
      lairds of Pitscottie's Highlanders, unmindful of the Kirk's harsh
      commandments of sobriety, sat cheek by jowl with rakehelly officers of
      Dalzell's Brigade, and pledged the King in many a stoup of canary and many
      a can of stout March ale.
    </p>
    <p>
      On every hand spirits ran high and laughter filled the chamber, the mirth
      of some having its source in a neighbour's quip, that of others having no
      source at all save in the wine they had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one table sat a gentleman of the name of Faversham, who had ridden on
      the previous night in that ill-fated camisado that should have resulted in
      the capture of Cromwell at Spetchley, but which, owing to a betrayal&mdash;when
      was a Stuart not betrayed and sold?&mdash;miscarried. He was relating to
      the group about him the details of that disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oddslife, gentlemen,&rdquo; he was exclaiming, &ldquo;I tell you that, but for that
      roaring dog, Sir Crispin Galliard, the whole of Middleton's regiment had
      been cut to pieces. There we stood on Red Hill, trapped as ever fish in a
      net, with the whole of Lilburne's men rising out of the ground to enclose
      and destroy us. A living wall of steel it was, and on every hand the call
      to surrender. There was dismay in my heart, as I'll swear there was dismay
      in the heart of every man of us, and I make little doubt, gentlemen, that
      with but scant pressing we had thrown down our arms, so disheartened were
      we by that ambush. Then of a sudden there arose above the clatter of steel
      and Puritan cries, a loud, clear, defiant shout of 'Hey for Cavaliers!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I turned, and there in his stirrups stood that madman Galliard, waving
      his sword and holding his company together with the power of his will, his
      courage, and his voice. The sight of him was like wine to our blood. 'Into
      them, gentlemen; follow me!' he roared. And then, with a hurricane of
      oaths, he hurled his company against the pike-men. The blow was
      irresistible, and above the din of it came that voice of his again: 'Up,
      Cavaliers! Slash the cuckolds to ribbons, gentlemen!' The cropears gave
      way, and like a river that has burst its dam, we poured through the
      opening in their ranks and headed back for Worcester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a roar of voices as Faversham ended, and around that table &ldquo;The
      Tavern Knight&rdquo; was for some minutes the only toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile half a dozen merry-makers at a table hard by, having drunk
      themselves out of all sense of fitness, were occupied in baiting a
      pale-faced lad, sombrely attired, who seemed sadly out of place in that
      wild company&mdash;indeed, he had been better advised to have avoided it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter had been set afoot by a pleasantry of Ensign Tyler's, of
      Massey's dragoons, with a playful allusion to a letter in a feminine hand
      which Kenneth had let fall, and which Tyler had restored to him. Quip had
      followed quip until in their jests they transcended all bounds. Livid with
      passion and unable to endure more, Kenneth had sprung up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; he blazed, bringing his clenched hand down upon the table.
      &ldquo;One more of your foul jests and he that utters it shall answer to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The suddenness of his action and the fierceness of his tone and gesture&mdash;a
      fierceness so grotesquely ill-attuned to his slender frame and clerkly
      attire left the company for a moment speechless with amazement. Then a
      mighty burst of laughter greeted him, above which sounded the shrill voice
      of Tyler, who held his sides, and down whose crimson cheeks two tears of
      mirth were trickling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fie, fie, good Master Stewart!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;What think you would the
      reverend elders say to this bellicose attitude and this profane tongue of
      yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what think you would the King say to this drunken poltroonery of
      yours?&rdquo; was the hot unguarded answer. &ldquo;Poltroonery, I say,&rdquo; he repeated,
      embracing the whole company in his glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laughter died down as Kenneth's insult penetrated their befuddled
      minds. An instant's lull there was, like the lull in nature that precedes
      a clap of thunder. Then, as with one accord, a dozen of them bore down
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a vile thing they did, perhaps; but then they had drunk deep, and
      Kenneth Stewart counted no friend amongst them. In an instant they had
      him, kicking and biting, on the floor; his doublet was torn rudely open,
      and from his breast Tyler plucked the letter whose existence had led to
      this shameless scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      But ere he could so much as unfold it, a voice rang harsh and imperative:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pausing, they turned to confront a tall, gaunt man in a leather jerkin and
      a broad hat decked by goose-quill, who came slowly forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Tavern Knight,&rdquo; cried one, and the shout of &ldquo;A rouse for the hero of
      Red Hill!&rdquo; was taken up on every hand. For despite his sour visage and
      ungracious ways there was not a roysterer in the Royal army to whom he was
      not dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he now advanced, the coldness of his bearing and the forbidding set
      of his face froze them into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me that letter,&rdquo; he demanded sternly of Tyler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taken aback, Tyler hesitated for a second, whilst Crispin waited with hand
      outstretched. Vainly did he look round for sign or word of help or
      counsel. None was afforded him by his fellow-revellers, who one and all
      hung back in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing himself thus unsupported, and far from wishing to try conclusions
      with Galliard, Tyler with an ill grace surrendered the paper; and, with a
      pleasant bow and a word of thanks, delivered with never so slight a
      saturnine smile, Crispin turned on his heel and left the tavern as
      abruptly as he had entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The din it was that had attracted him as he passed by on his way to the
      Episcopal Palace where a part of his company was on guard duty. Thither he
      now pursued his way, bearing with him the letter which so opportunely he
      had become possessed of, and which he hoped might throw further light upon
      Kenneth's relations with the Ashburns.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he reached the palace there was a quick step behind him, and a hand
      fell upon his arm. He turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, 'tis you, Kenneth,&rdquo; he muttered, and would have passed on, but the
      boy's hand took him by the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Crispin,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I came to thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done nothing to deserve your thanks. Give you good evening.&rdquo; And
      he made shift to mount the steps when again Kenneth detained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are forgetting the letter, Sir Crispin,&rdquo; he ventured, and he held out
      his hand to receive it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galliard saw the gesture, and for a moment it crossed his mind in
      self-reproach that the part he chose to play was that of a bully. A second
      he hesitated. Should he surrender the letter unread, and fight on without
      the aid of the information it might bring him? Then the thought of Ashburn
      and of his own deep wrongs that cried out for vengeance, overcame and
      stifled the generous impulse. His manner grew yet more frozen as he made
      answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has been too much ado about this letter to warrant my so lightly
      parting with it. First I will satisfy myself that I have been no
      unconscious abettor of treason. You shall have your letter tomorrow,
      Master Stewart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Treason!&rdquo; echoed Kenneth. And before that cold rebuff of Crispin's his
      mood changed from conciliatory to resentful&mdash;resentful towards the
      fates that made him this man's debtor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, on my honour,&rdquo; said he, mastering his feelings, &ldquo;that this
      is but a letter from the lady I hope to make my wife. Assuredly, sir, you
      will not now insist upon reading it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly I shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Stewart, I am resolved, and were you to talk from now till
      doomsday, you would not turn me from my purpose. So good night to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Crispin,&rdquo; cried the boy, his voice quavering with passion, &ldquo;while I
      live you shall not read that letter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoity-toity, sir! What words! What heroics! And yet you would have me
      believe this paper innocent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As innocent as the hand that penned it, and if I so oppose your reading
      it, it is because thus much I owe her. Believe me, sir,&rdquo; he added, his
      accents returning to a beseeching key, &ldquo;when again I swear that it is no
      more than such a letter any maid may write her lover. I thought that you
      had understood all this when you rescued me from those bullies at The
      Mitre. I thought that what you did was a noble and generous deed. Instead&mdash;&rdquo;
       The lad paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Continue, sir,&rdquo; Galliard requested coldly. &ldquo;Instead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no instead, Sir Crispin. You will not mar so good an action
      now. You will give me my letter, will you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Callous though he was, Crispin winced. The breeding of earlier days&mdash;so
      sadly warped, alas!&mdash;cried out within him against the lie that he was
      acting by pretending to suspect treason in that woman's pothooks.
      Instincts of gentility and generosity long dead took life again,
      resuscitated by that call of conscience. He was conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, take your letter, boy, and plague me no more,&rdquo; he growled, as he
      held it out to Kenneth. And without waiting for reply or acknowledgment,
      he turned on his heel, and entered the palace. But he had yielded overlate
      to leave a good impression and, as Kenneth turned away, it was with a
      curse upon Galliard, for whom his detestation seemed to increase at every
      step.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. AFTER WORCESTER FIELD
    </h2>
    <p>
      The morn of the third of September&mdash;that date so propitious to
      Cromwell, so disastrous to Charles&mdash;found Crispin the centre of a
      company of gentlemen in battle-harness, assembled at The Mitre Inn. For a
      toast he gave them &ldquo;The damnation of all crop-ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;a fair beginning to a fair day. God send the evening
      find us as merry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not to be his good fortune, however, to be in the earlier work of
      the day. Until afternoon he was kept within the walls of Worcester,
      chafing to be where hard knocks were being dealt&mdash;with Montgomery at
      Powick Bridge, or with Pittscottie on Bunn's Hill. But he was forced to
      hold his mood in curb, and wait until Charles and his advisers should
      elect to make the general attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came at last, and with it came the disastrous news that Montgomery was
      routed, and Pittscottie in full retreat, whilst Dalzell had surrendered,
      and Keith was taken. Then was it that the main body of the Royal army
      formed up at the Sidbury Gate, and Crispin found himself in the centre,
      which was commanded by the King in person. In the brilliant charge that
      followed there was no more conspicuous figure, no voice rang louder in
      encouragement to the men. For the first time that day Cromwell's Ironsides
      gave back before the Royalists, who in that fierce, irresistible charge,
      swept all before them until they had reached the battery on Perry Wood,
      and driven the Roundheads from it hell-to-leather.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a glorious moment, a moment in which the fortunes of the day hung
      in the balance; the turn of the tide it seemed to them at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crispin was among the first to reach the guns, and with a great shout of
      &ldquo;Hurrah for Cavaliers!&rdquo; he had cut down two gunners that yet lingered. His
      cry lacked not an echo, and a deafening cheer broke upon the clamorous air
      as the Royalists found themselves masters of the position. Up the hill on
      either side pressed the Duke of Hamilton and the Earl of Derby to support
      the King. It but remained for Lesley's Scottish horse to follow and
      complete the rout of the Parliamentarian forces. Had they moved at that
      supreme moment who shall say what had been the issue of Worcester field?
      But they never stirred, and the Royalists waiting on Perry Wood cursed
      Lesley for a foul traitor who had sold his King.
    </p>
    <p>
      With bitterness did they then realize that their great effort was to be
      barren, their gallant charge in vain. Unsupported, their position grew
      fast untenable.
    </p>
    <p>
      And presently, when Cromwell had gathered his scattered Ironsides, that
      gallant host was driven fighting, down the hill and back to the shelter of
      Worcester. With the Roundheads pressing hotly upon them they gained at
      last the Sidbury Gate, but only to find that an overset ammunition wagon
      blocked the entrance. In this plight, and without attempting to move it,
      they faced about to make a last stand against the Puritan onslaught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles had flung himself from his charger and climbed the obstruction,
      and in this he was presently followed by others, amongst whom was Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the High Street Galliard came upon the King, mounted on a fresh horse,
      addressing a Scottish regiment of foot. The soldiers had thrown down their
      arms and stood sullenly before him, refusing to obey his command to take
      them up again and help him attempt, even at that late hour, to retrieve
      the fortunes of the day. Crispin looked on in scorn and loathing. His
      passions awakened at the sight of Lesley's inaction needed but this last
      breath to fan it into a very blaze of wrath. And what he said to them
      touching themselves, their country, and the Kirk Committee that had made
      sheep of them, was so bitter and contemptuous that none but men in the
      most parlous and pitiable of conditions could have suffered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still hurling vituperations at them when Colonel Pride with a troop
      of Parliamentarian horse&mdash;having completely overcome the resistance
      at the Sidbury Gate&mdash;rode into the town. At the news of this, Crispin
      made a last appeal to the infantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afoot, you Scottish curs!&rdquo; he thundered. &ldquo;Would you rather be cut to
      pieces as you stand? Up, you dogs, and since you know not how to live, die
      at least without shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in vain did he rail. In sullen quiet they remained, their weapons on
      the ground before them. And then, as Crispin was turning away to see to
      his own safety, the King rode up again, and again he sought to revive the
      courage that was dead in those Scottish hearts. If they would not stand by
      him, he cried at last, let them slay him there, sooner than that he should
      be taken captive to perish on the scaffold.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was still urging them, Crispin unceremoniously seized his bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you stand here until you are taken, sire?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Leave them,
      and look to your safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles turned a wondering eye upon the resolute, battle-grimed face of
      the man that thus addressed him. A faint, sad smile parted his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, sir,&rdquo; he made answer. &ldquo;Attend me.&rdquo; And turning about he
      rode down a side street with Galliard following closely in his wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the intention of doffing his armour and changing his apparel, he made
      for the house in New Street where he had been residing. As they drew up
      before the door, Crispin, chancing to look over his shoulder, rapped out
      an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasten, sire,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;here is a portion of Colonel's Pride's
      troop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King looked round, and at sight of the Parliamentarians, &ldquo;It is
      ended,&rdquo; he muttered despairingly. But already Crispin had sprung from his
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dismount, sire,&rdquo; he roared, and he assisted him so vigorously as to
      appear to drag him out of the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; demanded Charles, looking helplessly from left to right.
      &ldquo;Which way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Crispin's quick mind had already shaped a plan. Seizing the royal arm&mdash;for
      who in such straits would deal ceremoniously?&mdash;he thrust the King
      across the threshold, and, following, closed the door and shot its only
      bolt. But the shout set up by the Puritans announced to them that their
      movement had been detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King turned upon Sir Crispin, and in the half-light of the passage
      wherein they stood Galliard made out the frown that bent the royal brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now?&rdquo; demanded Charles, a note almost of reproach in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now begone, sire,&rdquo; returned the knight. &ldquo;Begone ere they come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begone?&rdquo; echoed Charles, in amazement. &ldquo;But whither, sir? Whither and
      how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His last words were almost drowned in the din without, as the Roundheads
      pulled up before the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the back, sire,&rdquo; was the impatient answer. &ldquo;Through door or window&mdash;as
      best you can. The back must overlook the Corn-Market; that is your way.
      But hasten&mdash;in God's name hasten!&mdash;ere they bethink them of it
      and cut off your retreat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke a violent blow shook the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, Your Majesty,&rdquo; he implored, in a frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles moved to depart, then paused. &ldquo;But you, sir? Do you not come with
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin stamped his foot, and turned a face livid with impatience upon his
      King. In that moment all distinction of rank lay forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must remain,&rdquo; he answered, speaking quickly. &ldquo;That crazy door will not
      hold for a second once a stout man sets his shoulder to it. After the door
      they will find me, and for your sake I trust I may prove of stouter stuff.
      Fare you well, sire,&rdquo; he ended in a softer tone. &ldquo;God guard Your Majesty
      and send you happier days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, bending his knee, Crispin brushed the royal hand with his hot lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shower of blows clattered upon the timbers of the door, and one of its
      panels was splintered by a musket-shot. Charles saw it, and with a
      muttered word that was not caught by Crispin, he obeyed the knight, and
      fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarce had he disappeared down that narrow passage, when the door gave way
      completely and with a mighty crash fell in. Over the ruins of it sprang a
      young Puritan-scarce more than a boy&mdash;shouting: &ldquo;The Lord of Hosts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But ere he had taken three strides the point of Crispin's tuck-sword gave
      him pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt! You cannot pass this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back, son of Moab!&rdquo; was the Roundhead's retort. &ldquo;Hinder me not, at your
      peril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Behind him, in the doorway, pressed others, who cried out to him to cut
      down the Amalekite that stood between them and the young man Charles
      Stuart. But Crispin laughed grimly for answer, and kept the officer in
      check with his point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back, or I cut you down,&rdquo; threatened the Roundhead. &ldquo;I am seeking the
      malignant Stuart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If by those blasphemous words you mean his sacred Majesty, learn that he
      is where you will never be&mdash;in God's keeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presumptuous hound,&rdquo; stormed the lad, &ldquo;giveway!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their swords met, and for a moment they ground one against the other; then
      Crispin's blade darted out, swift as a lightning flash, and took his
      opponent in the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have it so, rash fool,&rdquo; he deprecated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy hurtled back into the arms of those behind, and as he fell he
      dropped his rapier, which rolled almost to Crispin's feet. The knight
      stooped, and when again he stood erect, confronting the rebels in that
      narrow passage, he held a sword in either hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a momentary pause in the onslaught, then to his dismay Crispin
      saw the barrel of a musket pointed at him over the shoulder of one of his
      foremost assailants. He set his teeth for what was to come, and braced
      himself with the hope that the King might already have made good his
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end was at hand, he thought, and a fitting end, since his last hope of
      redress was gone-destroyed by that fatal day's defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of a sudden a cry rang out in a voice wherein rage and anguish were
      blended fearfully, and simultaneously the musket barrel was dashed aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him alive!&rdquo; was the cry of that voice. &ldquo;Take him alive!&rdquo; It was
      Colonel Pride himself, who having pushed his way forward, now beheld the
      bleeding body of the youth Crispin had slain. &ldquo;Take him alive!&rdquo; roared the
      old man. Then his voice changing to one of exquisite agony&mdash;&ldquo;My son,
      my boy,&rdquo; he moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a glance Crispin caught the situation; but the old Puritan's grief left
      him unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have me alive?&rdquo; he laughed grimly. &ldquo;Gadslife, but the honour is
      like to cost you dear. Well, sirs? Who will be next to court the
      distinction of dying by the sword of a gentleman?&rdquo; he mocked them. &ldquo;Come
      on, you sons of dogs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His answer was an angry growl, and straightway two men sprang forward.
      More than two could not attack him at once by virtue of the narrowness of
      the passage. Again steel clashed on steel. Crispin&mdash;lithe as a
      panther crouched low, and took one of their swords on each of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      A disengage and a double he foiled with ease, then by a turn of the wrist
      he held for a second one opponent's blade; and before the fellow could
      disengage again, he had brought his right-hand sword across, and stabbed
      him in the neck. Simultaneously his other opponent had rushed in and
      thrust. It was a risk Crispin was forced to take, trusting to his armour
      to protect him. It did him the service he hoped from it; the trooper's
      sword glanced harmlessly aside, whilst the fellow himself, overbalanced by
      the fury of his onslaught, staggered helplessly forward. Ere he could
      recover, Crispin had spitted him from side to side betwixt the straps that
      held his back and breast together.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the two men went down, one after the other, the watching troopers set
      up a shout of rage, and pressed forward in a body. But the Tavern Knight
      stood his ground, and his points danced dangerously before the eyes of the
      two foremost. Alarmed, they shouted to those behind to give them room to
      handle their swords; but too late. Crispin had seen the advantage, and
      taken it. Twice he had thrust, and another two sank bleeding to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that there came a pause, and somewhere in the street a knot of them
      expostulated with Colonel Pride, and begged to be allowed to pick off that
      murderous malignant with their pistols. But the grief-stricken father was
      obdurate. He would have the Amalekite alive that he might cause him to die
      a hundred deaths in one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so two more were sent in to try conclusions with the indomitable
      Galliard. They went to work more warily. He on the left parried Crispin's
      stroke, then knocking up the knight's blade, he rushed in and seized his
      wrist, shouting to those behind to follow up. But even as he did so,
      Crispin sent back his other antagonist, howling and writhing with the pain
      of a transfixed sword-arm, and turned his full attention upon the foe that
      clung to him. Not a second did he waste in thought. To have done so would
      have been fatal. Instinctively he knew that whilst he shortened his blade,
      others would rush in; so, turning his wrist, he caught the man a crushing
      blow full in the face with the pommel of his disengaged sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fulminated by that terrific stroke, the man reeled back into the arms of
      another who advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there fell a pause. Then silently a Roundhead charged Sir Crispin
      with a pike. He leapt nimbly aside, and the murderous lunge shot past him;
      as he did so he dropped his left-hand sword and caught at the halberd.
      Exerting his whole strength in a mighty pull, he brought the fellow that
      wielded it toppling forward, and received him on his outstretched blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Covered with blood&mdash;the blood of others&mdash;Crispin stood before
      them now. He was breathing hard and sweating at every pore, but still grim
      and defiant. His strength, he realized, was ebbing fast. Yet he shook
      himself, and asked them with a gibing laugh did they not think that they
      had better shoot him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roundheads paused again. The fight had lasted but a few moments, and
      already five of them were stretched upon the ground, and a sixth disabled.
      There was something in the Tavern Knight's attitude and terrific,
      blood-bespattered appearance that deterred them. From out of his
      powder-blackened face his eyes flashed fiercely, and a mocking diabolical
      smile played round the corners of his mouth. What manner of man, they
      asked themselves, was this who could laugh in such an extremity?
      Superstition quickened their alarm as they gazed upon his undaunted front,
      and told themselves this was no man they fought against, but the foul
      fiend himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sirs,&rdquo; he mocked them presently. &ldquo;How long am I to await your
      pleasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They snarled for answer, yet hung back until Colonel Pride's voice shook
      them into action. In a body they charged him now, so suddenly and
      violently that he was forced to give way. Cunningly did he ply his sword
      before them, but ineffectually. They had adopted fresh tactics, and
      engaging his blade they acted cautiously and defensively, advancing
      steadily, and compelling him to fall back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Crispin guessed their scheme at last, and vainly did he try to hold
      his ground; his retreat slackened perhaps, but it was still a retreat, and
      their defensive action gave him no opening. Vainly, yet by every trick of
      fence he was master of, did he seek to lure the two foremost into
      attacking him; stolidly they pursued the adopted plan, and steadily they
      impelled him backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he reached the staircase, and he realized that did he allow
      himself to go farther he was lost irretrievably. Yet farther was he
      driven; despite the strenuous efforts he put forth, until on his right
      there was room for a man to slip on to the stairs and take him in the
      flank. Twice one of his opponents essayed it, and twice did Galliard's
      deadly point repel him. But at the third attempt the man got through,
      another stepped into his place in front, and thus from two, Crispin's
      immediate assailants became increased to three.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized that the end was at hand, and wildly did he lay about him, but
      to no purpose. And presently, he who had gained the stairs leaped suddenly
      upon him sideways, and clung to his swordarm. Before he could make a move
      to shake himself free, the two that faced him had caught at his other arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like one possessed he struggled then, for the sheer lust of striving; but
      they that held him gripped effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrice they bore him struggling to the ground, and thrice he rose again
      and sought to shake them from him as a bull shakes off a pack of dogs. But
      they held fast, and again they forced him down; others sprang to their
      aid, and the Tavern Knight could rise no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disarm the dog!&rdquo; cried Pride. &ldquo;Disarm and truss him hand and foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sirs, you need not,&rdquo; he answered, gasping. &ldquo;I yield me. Take my sword.
      I'll do your bidding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fight was fought and lost, but it had been a great Homeric struggle,
      and he rejoiced almost that upon so worthy a scene of his life was the
      curtain to fall, and again to hope that, thanks to the stand he had made,
      the King should have succeeded in effecting his escape.

      CHAPTER VI. COMPANIONS IN MISFORTUNE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Through the streets of Worcester the Roundheads dragged Sir Crispin, and
      for all that he was as hard and callous a man as any that ever buckled on
      a cuirass, the horrors that in going he beheld caused him more than once
      to shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was become a shambles, and the very kennels ran with blood. The
      Royalist defeat was by now complete, and Cromwell's fanatic butchers
      overran the town, vying to outdo one another in savage cruelty and murder.
      Houses were being broken into and plundered, and their inmates&mdash;resisting
      or unresisting; armed or unarmed; men, women and children alike were
      pitilessly being put to the sword. Charged was the air of Worcester with
      the din of that fierce massacre. The crashing of shivered timbers, as
      doors were beaten in, mingled with the clatter and grind of sword on
      sword, the crack of musket and pistol, the clank of armour, and the
      stamping of men and horses in that troubled hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      And above all rang out the fierce, raucous blasphemy of the slayers, and
      the shrieks of agony, the groans, the prayers, and curses of their
      victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this Sir Crispin saw and heard, and in the misery of it all, he for
      the while forgot his own sorry condition, and left unheeded the pike-butt
      wherewith the Puritan at his heels was urging him along.
    </p>
    <p>
      They paused at length in a quarter unknown to him before a tolerably large
      house. Its doors hung wide, and across the threshold, in and out, moved
      two continuous streams of officers and men.
    </p>
    <p>
      A while Crispin and his captors stood in the spacious hall; then they
      ushered him roughly into one of the abutting rooms. Here he was brought
      face to face with a man of middle height, red and coarse of countenance
      and large of nose, who stood fully armed in the centre of the chamber. His
      head was uncovered, and on the table at his side stood the morion he had
      doffed. He looked up as they entered, and for a few seconds rested his
      glance sourly upon the lank, bold-eyed prisoner, who coldly returned his
      stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom have we here?&rdquo; he inquired at length, his scrutiny having told him
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One whose offence is too heinous to have earned him a soldier's death, my
      lord,&rdquo; answered Pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therein you lie, you damned rebel!&rdquo; cried Crispin. &ldquo;If accuse you must,
      announce the truth. Tell Master Cromwell&rdquo;&mdash;for he had guessed the
      man's identity&mdash;&ldquo;that single-handed I held my own against you and a
      score of you curs, and that not until I had cut down seven of them was I
      taken. Tell him that, master psalm-singer, and let him judge whether you
      lied or not. Tell him, too, that you, who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have done!&rdquo; cried Cromwell at length, stamping his foot. &ldquo;Peace, or I'll
      have you gagged. Now, Colonel, let us hear your accusation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At great length, and with endless interlarding of proverbs did Pride
      relate how this impious malignant had been the means of the young man,
      Charles Stuart, making good his escape when otherwise he must have fallen
      into their hands. He accused him also of the murder of his son and of four
      other stout, God-fearing troopers, and urged Cromwell to let him deal with
      the malignant as he deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord General's answer took expression in a form that was little
      puritanical. Then, checking himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the second they have brought me within ten minutes charged with the
      same offence,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The other one is a young fool who gave Charles
      Stuart his horse at Saint Martin's Gate. But for him again the young man
      had been taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he has escaped!&rdquo; cried Crispin. &ldquo;Now, God be praised!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cromwell stared at him blankly for a moment, then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do well, sir,&rdquo; he muttered sourly, &ldquo;to address the Lord on your
      own behalf. As for that young man of Baal, your master, rejoice not yet in
      his escape. By the same crowning mercy in which the Lord hath vouchsafed
      us victory to-day shall He also deliver the malignant youth into my hands.
      For your share in retarding his capture your life, sir, shall pay forfeit.
      You shall hang at daybreak together with that other malignant who assisted
      Charles at the Saint Martin's Gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall at least hang in good company,&rdquo; said Crispin pleasantly, &ldquo;and for
      that, sir, I give you thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will pass the night with that other fool,&rdquo; Cromwell continued,
      without heeding the interruption, &ldquo;and I pray that you may spend it in
      such meditation as shall fit you for your end. Take him away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my lord,&rdquo; exclaimed Pride, advancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin caught not his answer, but his half-whispered words were earnest
      and pleading. Cromwell shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot sanction it. Let it satisfy you that he dies. I condole with you
      in your bereavement, but it is the fortune of war. Let the thought that
      your son died in a godly cause be of comfort to you. Bear in mind, Colonel
      Pride, that Abraham hesitated not to offer up his child to the Lord. And
      so, fare you well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Pride's face worked oddly, and his eyes rested for a second upon
      the stern, unmoved figure of the Tavern Knight in malice and
      vindictiveness. Then, shrugging his shoulders in token of unwilling
      resignation, he withdrew, whilst Crispin was led out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall again they kept him waiting for some moments, until at length
      an officer came up, and bidding him follow, led the way to the guardroom.
      Here they stripped him of his back-and-breast, and when that was done the
      officer again led the way, and Crispin followed between two troopers. They
      made him mount three flights of stairs, and hurried him along a passage to
      a door by which a soldier stood mounting guard. At a word from the officer
      the sentry turned, and unfastening the heavy bolts, he opened the door.
      Roughly the officer bade Sir Crispin enter, and stood aside that he might
      pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crispin obeyed him silently, and crossed the threshold to find himself
      within a mean, gloomy chamber, and to hear the heavy door closed and made
      fast again behind him. His stout heart sank a little as he realized that
      that closed door shut out to him the world for ever; but once again would
      he cross that threshold, and that would be the preface to the crossing of
      the greater threshold of eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then something stirred in one of that room's dark corners, and he started,
      to see that he was not alone, remembering that Cromwell had said he was to
      have a companion in his last hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; came a dull voice&mdash;a voice that was eloquent of
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Stewart!&rdquo; he exclaimed, recognizing his companion. &ldquo;So it was you
      gave the King your horse at the Saint Martin's Gate! May Heaven reward
      you. Gadswounds,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I had little thought to meet you again this
      side the grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to Heaven you had not!&rdquo; was the doleful answer. &ldquo;What make you
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By your good leave and with your help I'll make as merry as a man may
      whose sands are all but run. The Lord General&mdash;whom the devil roast
      in his time will make a pendulum of me at daybreak, and gives me the night
      in which to prepare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lad came forward into the light, and eyed Sir Crispin sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are companions in misfortune, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were we ever companions in aught else? Come, sir, be of better cheer.
      Since it is to be our last night in this poor world, let us spend it as
      pleasantly as may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasantly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twill clearly be difficult,&rdquo; answered Crispin, with a laugh. &ldquo;Were we in
      Christian hands they'd not deny us a black jack over which to relish our
      last jest, and to warm us against the night air, which must be chill in
      this garret. But these crop-ears...&rdquo; He paused to peer into the pitcher on
      the table. &ldquo;Water! Pah! A scurvy lot, these psalm-mongers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful Heaven! Have you no thought for your end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every thought, good youth, every thought, and I would fain prepare me for
      the morning's dance in a more jovial and hearty fashion than Old Noll will
      afford me&mdash;damn him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth drew back in horror. His old dislike for Crispin was all aroused
      by this indecent flippancy at such a time. Just then the thought of
      spending the night in his company almost effaced the horror of the gallows
      whereof he had been a prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noting the movement, Crispin laughed disdainfully, and walked towards the
      window. It was a small opening, by which two iron bars, set crosswise,
      defied escape. Moreover, as Crispin looked out, he realized that a more
      effective barrier lay in the height of the window itself. The house
      overlooked the river on that side; it was built upon an embankment some
      thirty feet high; around this, at the base of the edifice, and some forty
      feet below the window, ran a narrow pathway protected by an iron railing.
      But so narrow was it, that had a man sprung from the casement of Crispin's
      prison, it was odds he would have fallen into the river some seventy feet
      below. Crispin turned away with a sigh. He had approached the window
      almost in hope; he quitted it in absolute despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we will hang, and there's the end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth had resumed his seat in the corner, and, wrapped in his cloak, he
      sat steeped in meditation, his comely young face seared with lines of
      pain. As Crispin looked upon him then, his heart softened and went out to
      the lad&mdash;went out as it had done on the night when first he had
      beheld him in the courtyard of Perth Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recalled the details of that meeting; he remembered the sympathy that
      had drawn him to the boy, and how Kenneth had at first appeared to
      reciprocate that feeling, until he came to know him for the rakehelly,
      godless ruffler that he was. He thought of the gulf that gradually had
      opened up between them. The lad was righteous and God-fearing, truthful
      and sober, filled with stern ideals by which he sought to shape his life.
      He had taxed Crispin with his dissoluteness, and Crispin, despising him
      for a milksop, had returned to his disgust with mockery, and had found a
      fiendish pleasure in arousing that disgust at every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night, as Crispin eyed the youth, and remembered that at dawn he was to
      die in his company, he realized that he had used him ill, that his
      behaviour towards him had been that of the dissolute ruffler he was
      become, rather than of the gentleman he had once accounted himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kenneth,&rdquo; he said at length, and his voice bore so unusually mild a ring
      that the lad looked up in surprise. &ldquo;I have heard tell that it is no
      uncommon thing for men upon the threshold of eternity to seek to repair
      some of the evil they may have done in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth shuddered. Crispin's words reminded him again of his approaching
      end. The ruffler paused a moment, as if awaiting a reply or a word of
      encouragement. Then, as none came, he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not one of your repentant sinners, Kenneth. I have lived my life&mdash;God,
      what a life!&mdash;and as I have lived I shall die, unflinching and
      unchanged. Dare one to presume that a few hours spent in whining prayers
      shall atone for years of reckless dissoluteness? 'Tis a doctrine of
      cravens, who, having lacked in life the strength to live as conscience
      bade them, lack in death the courage to stand by that life's deeds. I am
      no such traitor to myself. If my life has been vile my temptations have
      been sore, and the rest is in God's hands. But in my course I have sinned
      against many men; many a tall fellow's life have I wantonly wrecked; some,
      indeed, I have even taken in wantonness or anger. They are not by, nor,
      were they, could I now make amends. But you at least are here, and what
      little reparation may lie in asking pardon I can make. When I first saw
      you at Perth it was my wish to make you my friend&mdash;a feeling I have
      not had these twenty years towards any man. I failed. How else could it
      have been? The dove may not nest with the carrion bird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more, sir,&rdquo; cried Kenneth, genuinely moved, and still more amazed
      by this curious humility in one whom he had never known other than
      arrogant and mocking. &ldquo;I beseech you, say no more. For what trifling
      wrongs you may have done me I forgive you as freely as I would be
      forgiven. Is it not written that it shall be so?&rdquo; And he held out his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little more I must say, Kenneth,&rdquo; answered the other, leaving the
      outstretched hand unheeded. &ldquo;The feeling that was born in me towards you
      at Perth Castle is on me again. I seek not to account for it. Perchance it
      springs from my recognition of the difference betwixt us; perchance I see
      in you a reflection of what once I was myself&mdash;honourable and true.
      But let that be. The sun is setting over yonder, and you and I will behold
      it no more. That to me is a small thing. I am weary. Hope is dead; and
      when that is dead what does it signify that the body die also? Yet in
      these last hours that we shall spend together I would at least have your
      esteem. I would have you forget my past harshness and the wrongs that I
      may have done you down to that miserable affair of your sweetheart's
      letter, yesterday. I would have you realize that if I am vile, I am but
      such as a vile world hath made me. And tomorrow when we go forth together,
      I would have you see in me at least a man in whose company you are not
      ashamed to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the lad shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you my story, Kenneth? I have a strong desire to go over
      this poor life of mine again in memory, and by giving my thoughts
      utterance it may be that they will take more vivid shape. For the rest my
      tale may wile away a little of the time that's left, and when you have
      heard me you shall judge me, Kenneth. What say you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Despite the parlous condition whereunto the fear of the morrow had reduced
      him, this new tone of Galliard's so wrought upon him then that he was
      almost eager in his request that Sir Crispin should unfold his story. And
      this the Tavern Knight then set himself to do.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE TAVERN KNIGHT'S STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir Crispin walked from the window by which he had been standing, to the
      rough bed, and flung himself full length upon it. The only chair that
      dismal room contained was occupied by Kenneth. Galliard heaved a sigh of
      physical satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fore George, I knew not I was so tired,&rdquo; he murmured. And with that he
      lapsed for some moments into silence, his brows contracted in the frown of
      one who collects his thoughts. At length he began, speaking in calm,
      unemotional tones that held perchance deeper pathos than a more passionate
      utterance could have endowed them with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long ago&mdash;twenty years ago&mdash;I was, as I have said, an
      honourable lad, to whom the world was a fair garden, a place of rosebuds,
      fragrant with hope. Those, Kenneth, were my illusions. They are the
      illusions of youth; they are youth itself, for when our illusions are gone
      we are no longer young no matter what years we count. Keep your illusions,
      Kenneth; treasure them, hoard them jealously for as long as you may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare swear, sir,&rdquo; answered the lad, with bitter humour, &ldquo;that such
      illusions as I have I shall treasure all my life. You forget, Sir
      Crispin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Slife, I had indeed forgotten. For the moment I had gone back twenty
      years, and to-morrow was none so near.&rdquo; He laughed softly, as though his
      lapse of memory amused him. Then he resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was the only son, Kenneth, of the noblest gentleman that ever lived&mdash;the
      heir to an ancient, honoured name, and to a castle as proud and lands as
      fair and broad as any in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They lie who say that from the dawn we may foretell the day. Never was
      there a brighter dawn than that of my life; never a day so wasted; never
      an evening so dark. But let that be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our lands were touched upon the northern side by those of a house with
      which we had been at feud for two hundred years and more. Puritans they
      were, stern and haughty in their ungodly righteousness. They held us
      dissolute because we enjoyed the life that God had given us, and there I
      am told the hatred first began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was a lad of your years, Kenneth, the hall&mdash;ours was the
      castle, theirs the hall&mdash;was occupied by two young sparks who made
      little shift to keep up the pious reputation of their house. They dwelt
      there with their mother&mdash;a woman too weak to check their ways, and
      holding, mayhap, herself, views not altogether puritanical. They discarded
      the sober black their forbears had worn for generations, and donned gay
      Cavalier garments. They let their love-locks grow; set plumes in their
      castors and jewels in their ears; they drank deep, ruffled it with the
      boldest and decked their utterance with great oaths&mdash;for to none doth
      blasphemy come more readily than to lips that in youth have been overmuch
      shaped in unwilling prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me they avoided as they would a plague, and when at times we met, our
      salutations were grave as those of, men on the point of crossing swords. I
      despised them for their coarse, ruffling apostasy more than ever my father
      had despised their father for a bigot, and they guessing or knowing by
      instinct what was in my mind held me in deeper rancour even than their
      ancestors had done mine. And more galling still and yet a sharper spur to
      their hatred did those whelps find in the realization that all the
      countryside held, as it had held for ages, us to be their betters. A hard
      blow to their pride was that, but their revenge was not long in coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It chanced they had a cousin&mdash;a maid as sweet and fair and pure as
      they were hideous and foul. We met in the meads&mdash;she and I. Spring
      was the time&mdash;God! It seems but yesterday!&mdash;and each in our
      bearing towards the other forgot the traditions of the names we bore. And
      as at first we had met by chance, so did we meet later by contrivance, not
      once or twice, but many times. God, how sweet she was! How sweet was all
      the world! How sweet it was to live and to be young! We loved. How else
      could it have been? What to us were traditions, what to us the hatred that
      for centuries had held our families asunder? In us it lay to set aside all
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I sought my father. He cursed me at first for an unnatural son who
      left unheeded the dictates of our blood. But anon, when on my knees I had
      urged my cause with all the eloquent fervour that is but of youth&mdash;youth
      that loves&mdash;my father cursed no more. His thoughts went back maybe to
      the days of his own youth, and he bade me rise and go a-wooing as I
      listed. Nay, more than that he did. The first of our name was he out of
      ten generations to set foot across the threshold of the hall; he went on
      my behalf to sue for their cousin's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then was their hour. To them that had been taught the humiliating lesson
      that we were their betters, one of us came suing. They from whom the
      countryside looked for silence when one of us spoke, had it in their hands
      at length to say us nay. And they said it. What answer my father made
      them, Kenneth, I know not, but very white was his face when I met him on
      the castle steps on his return. In burning words he told me of the insult
      they had put upon him, then silently he pointed to the Toledo that two
      years before he had brought me out of Spain, and left me. But I had
      understood. Softly I unsheathed that virgin blade and read the Spanish
      inscription, that through my tears of rage and shame seemed blurred; a
      proud inscription was it, instinct with the punctilio of proud Spain&mdash;'Draw
      me not without motive, sheathe me not without honour.' Motive there was
      and to spare; honour I swore there should be; and with that oath, and that
      brave sword girt to me, I set out to my first combat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Crispin paused and a sigh escaped him, followed by a laugh of
      bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lost that sword years ago,&rdquo; said he musingly. &ldquo;The sword and I have
      been close friends in life, but my companion has been a blade of coarser
      make, carrying no inscriptions to prick at a man's conscience and make a
      craven of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again, and again he fell a-musing, till Kenneth's voice aroused
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your story, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twilight shadows were gathering in their garret, and as he turned his face
      towards the youth, he was unable to make out his features; but his tone
      had been eager, and Crispin noted that he sat with head bent forward and
      that his eyes shone feverishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It interests you, eh? Ah, well&mdash;hot foot I went to the hall, and
      with burning words I called upon those dogs to render satisfaction for the
      dishonour they had put upon my house. Will you believe, Kenneth, that they
      denied me? They sheltered their craven lives behind a shield of mock
      valour. They would not fight a boy, they said, and bade me get my beard
      grown when haply they would give ear to my grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, a shame and rage a hundredfold more bitter than that which I had
      borne thither did I carry thence. My father bade me treasure up the memory
      of it against the time when my riper years should compel them to attend
      me, and this, by my every hope of heaven, I swore to do. He bade me
      further efface for ever from my mind all thought or hope of union with
      their cousin, and though I made him no answer at the time, yet in my heart
      I promised to obey him in that, too. But I was young&mdash;scarce twenty.
      A week without sight of my mistress and I grew sick with despair. Then at
      length I came upon her, pale and tearful, one evening, and in an agony of
      passion and hopelessness I flung myself at her feet, and implored her to
      keep true to me and wait, and she, poor maid, to her undoing swore that
      she would. You are yourself a lover, Kenneth, and you may guess something
      of the impatience that anon beset me. How could I wait? I asked her this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some fifty miles from the castle there was a little farm, in the very
      heart of the country, which had been left me by a sister of my mother's.
      Thither I now implored her to repair with me. I would find a priest to wed
      us, and there we should live a while in happiness, in solitude, and in
      love. An alluring picture did I draw with all a lover's cunning, and to
      the charms of it she fell a victim. We fled three days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were wed in the village that pays allegiance to the castle, and
      thereafter we travelled swiftly and undisturbed to that little homestead.
      There in solitude, with but two servants&mdash;a man and a maid whom I
      could trust&mdash;we lived and loved, and for a season, brief as all
      happiness is doomed to be, we were happy. Her cousins had no knowledge of
      that farm of mine, and though they searched the country for many a mile
      around, they searched in vain. My father knew&mdash;as I learned
      afterwards&mdash;but deeming that what was done might not be undone, he
      held his peace. In the following spring a babe was born to us, and our
      bliss made heaven of that cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twas a month or so after the birth of our child that the blow descended.
      I was away, enjoying alone the pleasures of the chase; my man was gone a
      journey to the nearest town, whence he would not return until the morrow.
      Oft have I cursed the folly that led me to take my gun and go forth into
      the woods, leaving no protector for my wife but one weak woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I returned earlier than I had thought to do, led mayhap by some angel
      that sought to have me back in time. But I came too late. At my gate I
      found two freshly ridden horses tethered, and it was with a dull
      foreboding in my heart that I sprang through the open door. Within&mdash;O
      God, the anguish of it!&mdash;stretched on the floor I beheld my love, a
      gaping sword-wound in her side, and the ground all bloody about her. For a
      moment I stood dumb in the spell of that horror, then a movement beyond,
      against the wall, aroused me, and I beheld her murderers cowering there,
      one with a naked sword in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that fell hour, Kenneth, my whole nature changed, and one who had ever
      been gentle was transformed into the violent, passionate man that you have
      known. As my eye encountered then her cousins, my blood seemed on the
      instant curdled in my veins; my teeth were set hard; my nerves and sinews
      knotted; my hands instinctively shifted to the barrel of my fowling-piece
      and clutched it with the fierceness that was in me&mdash;the fierceness of
      the beast about to spring upon those that have brought it to bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a moment I stood swaying there, my eyes upon them, and holding their
      craven glances fascinated. Then with a roar I leapt forward, the stock of
      my fowling-piece swung high above my head. And, as God lives, Kenneth, I
      had sent them straight to hell ere they could have raised a hand or made a
      cry to stay me. But as I sprang my foot slipped in the blood of my
      beloved, and in my fall I came close to her where she lay. The
      fowling-piece had escaped my grasp and crashed against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarce knew what I did, but as I lay beside her it came to me that I
      did not wish to rise again&mdash;that already I had lived overlong. It
      came to me that, seeing me fallen, haply those cowards would seize the
      chance to make an end of me as I lay. I wished it so in that moment's
      frenzy, for I made no attempt to rise or to defend myself; instead I set
      my arms about my poor murdered love, and against her cold cheek I set my
      face that was well-nigh as cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thus I lay, nor did they keep me long. A sword was passed through me
      from back to breast, whilst he who did it cursed me with a foul oath. The
      room grew dim; methought it swayed and that the walls were tottering;
      there was a buzz of sound in my ears, then a piercing cry in a baby voice.
      At the sound of it I vaguely wished for the strength to rise. As in the
      distance, I heard one of those butchers cry, &ldquo;Haste, man; slit me that
      squalling bastard's throat!&rdquo; And then I must have swooned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, how horrible!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;But you were avenged, Sir Crispin,&rdquo; he
      added eagerly; &ldquo;you were avenged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I regained consciousness,&rdquo; Crispin continued, as if he had not heard
      Kenneth's exclamation, &ldquo;the cottage was in flames, set alight by them to
      burn the evidence of their foul deed. What I did I know not. I have tried
      to urge my memory along from the point of my awakening, but in vain. By
      what miracle I crawled forth, I cannot tell; but in the morning I was
      found by my man lying prone in the garden, half a dozen paces from the
      blackened ruins of the cottage, as near death as man may go and live.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God willed that I should not die, but it was close upon a year before I
      was restored to any semblance of my former self, and then I was so changed
      that I was hardly to be recognized as that same joyous, vigorous lad, who
      had set out, fowling-piece on shoulder, one fine morning a year agone.
      There was grey in my hair, as much as there is now, though I was but
      twenty-one; my face was seared and marked as that of a man who had lived
      twice my years. It was to my faithful servant that I owed my life, though
      I ask myself to-night whether I have cause for gratitude towards him on
      that score.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So soon as I had regained sufficient strength, I went secretly home,
      wishing that men might continue to believe me dead. My father I found much
      aged by grief, but he was kind and tender with me beyond all words. From
      him I had it that our enemies were gone to France; it would seem they had
      thought it better to remain absent for a while. He had learnt that they
      were in Paris, and hither I determined forthwith to follow them. Vainly
      did my father remonstrate with me; vainly did he urge me rather: to bear
      my story to the King at Whitehall and seek for justice. I had been well
      advised had I obeyed this counsel, but I burned to take my vengeance with
      my own hands, and with this purpose I repaired to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two nights after my arrival in Paris it was my ill-fortune to be
      embroiled in a rough-and-tumble in the streets, and by an ill-chance I
      killed a man&mdash;the first was he of several that I have sent whither I
      am going to-morrow. The affair was like to have cost me my life, but by
      another of those miracles which have prolonged it, I was sent instead to
      the galleys on the Mediterranean. It was only wanting that, after all that
      already I had endured, I should become a galley-slave!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For twelve long years I toiled at an oar, and waited. If I lived I would
      return to England; and if I returned, woe unto those that had wrecked my
      life&mdash;my body and my soul. I did live, and I did return. The Civil
      War had broken out, and I came to throw my sword into the balance on the
      King's side: I came, too, to be avenged, but that would wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile, the score had grown heavier. I went home to find the castle in
      usurping hands&mdash;in the hands of my enemies. My father was dead; he
      died a few months after I had gone to France; and those murderers had
      advanced a claim that through my marriage with their cousin, since dead,
      and through my own death, there being no next of kin, they were the
      heirs-at-law. The Parliament allowed their claim, and they were installed.
      But when I came they were away, following the fortunes of the Parliament
      that had served them so well. And so I determined to let my vengeance wait
      until the war were ended and the Parliament destroyed. In a hundred
      engagements did I distinguish myself by my recklessness even as at other
      seasons I distinguished myself by my debaucheries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Kenneth, you have been hard upon me for my vices, for my abuses of
      the cup, and all the rest. But can you be hard upon me still, knowing what
      I had suffered, and what a weight of misery I bore with me? I, whose life
      was wrecked beyond salvation; who only lived that I might slit the throats
      of those that had so irreparably wronged me. Think you still that it was
      so vicious a thing, so unpardonable an offence to seek the blessed
      nepenthe of the wine-cup, the heavenly forgetfulness that its abuses
      brought me? Is it strange that I became known as the wildest tantivy boy
      that rode with the King? What else had I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In all truth your trials were sore,&rdquo; said the lad in a voice that
      contained a note of sympathy. And yet there was a certain restraint that
      caught the Tavern Knight's ear. He turned his head and bent his eyes in
      the lad's direction, but it was quite dark by now, and he failed to make
      out his companion's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My tale is told, Kenneth. The rest you can guess. The King did not
      prevail and I was forced to fly from England with those others who escaped
      from the butchers that had made a martyr of Charles. I took service in
      France under the great Conde, and I saw some mighty battles. At length
      came the council of Breda and the invitation to Charles the Second to
      receive the crown of Scotland. I set out again to follow his fortunes as I
      had followed his father's, realizing that by so doing I followed my own,
      and that did he prevail I should have the redress and vengeance so long
      awaited. To-day has dashed my last hope; to-morrow at this hour it will
      not signify. And yet much would I give to have my fingers on the throats
      of those two hounds before the hangman's close around my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a spell of silence as the two men sat, both breathing heavily in
      the gloom that enveloped them. At length:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard my story, Kenneth,&rdquo; said Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard, Sir Crispin, and God knows I pity you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all, and Galliard felt that it was not enough. He had lacerated
      his soul with those grim memories to earn a yet kinder word. He had looked
      even to hear the lad suing for pardon for the harsh opinions wherein he
      had held him. Strange was this yearning of his for the boy's sympathy. He
      who for twenty years had gone unloving and unloved, sought now in his
      extremity affection from a fellow-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so in the gloom he waited for a kinder word that came not; then&mdash;so
      urgent was his need&mdash;he set himself to beg it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you not understand now, Kenneth, how I came to fall so low? Can you
      not understand this dissoluteness of mine, which led them to dub me the
      Tavern Knight after the King conferred upon me the honour of knighthood
      for that stand of mine in Fifeshire? You must understand, Kenneth,&rdquo; he
      insisted almost piteously, &ldquo;and knowing all, you must judge me more
      mercifully than hitherto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not mine to judge, Sir Crispin. I pity you with all my heart,&rdquo; the
      lad replied, not ungently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the knight was dissatisfied. &ldquo;Yours it is to judge as every man may
      judge his fellowman. You mean it is not yours to sentence. But if yours it
      were, Kenneth, what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lad paused a moment ere he answered. His bigoted Presbyterian training
      was strong within him, and although, as he said, he pitied Galliard, yet
      to him whose mind was stuffed with life's precepts, and who knew naught of
      the trials it brings to some and the temptations to which they were not
      human did they not succumb&mdash;it seemed that vice was not to be excused
      by misfortune. Out of mercy then he paused, and for a moment he had it
      even in his mind to cheer his fellow-captive with a lie. Then, remembering
      that he was to die upon the morrow, and that at such a time it was not
      well to risk the perdition of his soul by an untruth, however merciful, he
      answered slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were I to judge you, since you ask me, sir, I should be merciful because
      of your misfortunes. And yet, Sir Crispin, your profligacy and the evil
      you have wrought in life must weigh heavily against you.&rdquo; Had this
      immaculate bigot, this churlish milksop been as candid with himself as he
      was with Crispin, he must have recognized that it was mainly Crispin's
      offences towards himself that his mind now dwelt on in deeper rancour than
      became one so well acquainted with the Lord's Prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had not cause enough,&rdquo; he added impressively, &ldquo;to defile your soul
      and risk its eternal damnation because the evil of others had wrecked your
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin drew breath with the sharp hiss of one in pain, and for a moment
      after all was still. Then a bitter laugh broke from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravely answered, reverend sir,&rdquo; he cried with biting scorn. &ldquo;I marvel
      only that you left your pulpit to gird on a sword; that you doffed your
      cassock to don a cuirass. Here is a text for you who deal in texts, my
      brave Jack Presbyter&mdash;'Judge you your neighbour as you would yourself
      be judged; be merciful as you would hope for mercy.' Chew you the cud of
      that until the hangman's coming in the morning. Good night to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And throwing himself back upon the bed, Crispin sought comfort in sleep.
      His limbs were heavy and his heart was sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You misapprehend me, Sir Crispin,&rdquo; cried the lad, stung almost to shame
      by Galliard's reproach, and also mayhap into some fear that hereafter he
      should find little mercy for his own lack of it towards a poor
      fellow-sinner. &ldquo;I spoke not as I would judge, but as the Church teaches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Church teaches no better I rejoice that I was no churchman,&rdquo;
       grunted Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For myself,&rdquo; the lad pursued, heeding not the irreverent interruption,
      &ldquo;as I have said, I pity you with all my heart. More than that, so deeply
      do I feel, so great a loathing and indignation has your story sown in my
      heart, that were our liberty now restored us I would willingly join hands
      with you in wreaking vengeance on these evildoers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Crispin laughed. He judged the tone rather than the words, and it rang
      hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your wits, O casuist?&rdquo; he cried mockingly. &ldquo;Where are your
      doctrines? 'Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord!' Pah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that final ejaculation, pregnant with contempt and bitterness, he
      composed himself to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was accursed he told himself. He must die alone, as he had lived.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE TWISTED BAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nature asserted herself, and, despite his condition, Crispin slept.
      Kenneth sat huddled on his chair, and in awe and amazement he listened to
      his companion's regular breathing. He had not Galliard's nerves nor
      Galliard's indifference to death, so that neither could he follow his
      example, nor yet so much as realize how one should slumber upon the very
      brink of eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment his wonder stood perilously near to admiration; then his
      religious training swayed him, and his righteousness almost drew from him
      a contempt of this man's apathy. There was much of the Pharisee's attitude
      towards the publican in his mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anon that regular breathing grew irritating to him; it drew so marked a
      contrast 'twixt Crispin's frame of mind and his own. Whilst Crispin had
      related his story, the interest it awakened had served to banish the
      spectre of fear which the thought of the morrow conjured up. Now that
      Crispin was silent and asleep, that spectre returned, and the lad grew
      numb and sick with the horror of his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thought followed thought as he sat huddled there with sunken head and
      hands clasped tight between his knees, and they were mostly of his dull
      uneventful days in Scotland, and ever and anon of Cynthia, his beloved.
      Would she hear of his end? Would she weep for him?&mdash;as though it
      mattered! And every train of thought that he embarked upon brought him to
      the same issue&mdash;to-morrow! Shuddering he would clench his hands still
      tighter, and the perspiration would stand' out in beads upon his callow
      brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he flung himself upon his knees to address not so much a prayer
      as a maudlin grievance to his Creator. He felt himself a craven&mdash;doubly
      so by virtue of the peaceful breathing of that sinner he despised&mdash;and
      he told himself that it was not in fear a gentleman should meet his end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall be brave to-morrow. I shall be brave,&rdquo; he muttered, and knew
      not that it was vanity begat the thought, and vanity that might uphold him
      on the morrow when there were others by, however broken might be his
      spirit now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Crispin slept. When he awakened the light of a lanthorn was on
      his face, and holding it stood beside him a tall black figure in a cloak
      and a slouched hat whose broad brim left the features unrevealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still half asleep, and blinking like an owl, he sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always held burnt sack to be well enough, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short, fully awake at last, and, suddenly remembering his
      condition and thinking they were come for him, he drew a sharp breath and
      in a voice as indifferent as he could make it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's o'clock?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Past midnight, miserable wretch,&rdquo; was the answer delivered in a deep
      droning voice. &ldquo;Hast entered upon thy last day of life&mdash;a day whose
      sun thou'lt never see. But five hours more are left thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is to tell me this that you have awakened me?&rdquo; demanded Galliard
      in such a voice that he of the cloak recoiled a step, as if he thought a
      blow must follow. &ldquo;Out on you for an unmannerly cur to break upon a
      gentleman's repose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come,&rdquo; returned the other in his droning voice, &ldquo;to call upon thee to
      repent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plague me not,&rdquo; answered Crispin, with a yawn. &ldquo;I would sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soundly enough shalt thou sleep in a few hours' time. Bethink thee,
      miserable sinner, of thy soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried the Tavern Knight, &ldquo;I am a man of marvellous short endurance.
      But mark you this your ways to heaven are not my ways. Indeed, if heaven
      be peopled by such croaking things as you, I shall be thankful to escape
      it. So go, my friend, ere I become discourteous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister stood in silence for a moment; then setting his lanthorn upon
      the table, he raised his hands and eyes towards the low ceiling of the
      chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vouchsafe, O Lord,&rdquo; he prayed, &ldquo;to touch yet the callous heart of this
      obdurate, incorrigible sinner, this wicked, perjured and blasphemous
      malignant, whose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got no further. Crispin was upon his feet, his harsh countenance thrust
      into the very face of the minister; his eyes ablaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out!&rdquo; he thundered, pointing to the door. &ldquo;Out! Begone! I would not be
      guilty at the end of my life of striking a man in petticoats. But go
      whilst I can bethink me of it! Go&mdash;take your prayers to hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister fell back before that blaze of passion. For a second he
      appeared to hesitate, then he turned towards Kenneth, who stood behind in
      silence. But the lad's Presbyterian rearing had taught him to hate a
      sectarian as he would a papist or as he would the devil, and he did no
      more than echo Galliard's words&mdash;though in a gentler key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But if you would perform an act of charity,
      leave your lanthorn. It will be dark enough hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister looked keenly at the boy, and won over by the humility of his
      tone, he set the lanthorn on the table. Then moving towards the door, he
      stopped and addressed himself to Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go since you oppose with violence my ministrations. But I shall pray
      for you, and I will return anon, when perchance your heart shall be
      softened by the near imminence of your end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; quoth Crispin wearily, &ldquo;you would outtalk a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've done, I've done,&rdquo; he cried in trepidation, making shift to depart.
      On the threshold he paused again. &ldquo;I leave you the lanthorn,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;May it light you to a godlier frame of mind. I shall return at daybreak.&rdquo;
       And with that he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crispin yawned noisily when he was gone, and stretched himself. Then
      pointing to the pallet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, lad, 'tis your turn,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth shivered. &ldquo;I could not sleep,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I could not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will.&rdquo; And shrugging his shoulders, Crispin sat down on the edge
      of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For cold comforters commend me to these cropeared cuckolds,&rdquo; he grumbled.
      &ldquo;They are all thought for a man's soul, but for his body they care
      nothing. Here am I who for the last ten hours have had neither meat nor
      drink. Not that I mind the meat so much, but, 'slife, my throat is dry as
      one of their sermons, and I would cheerfully give four of my five hours of
      life for a posset of sack. A paltry lot are they, Kenneth, holding that
      because a man must die at dawn he need not sup to-night. Heigho! Some liar
      hath said that he who sleeps dines, and if I sleep perchance I shall
      forget my thirst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stretched himself upon the bed, and presently he slept again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Kenneth who next awakened him. He opened his eyes to find the lad
      shivering as with an ague. His face was ashen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what's amiss? Oddslife, what ails you?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no way, Sir Crispin? Is there naught you can do?&rdquo; wailed the
      youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly Galliard sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor lad, does the thought of the rope affright you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth bowed his head in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis a scurvy death, I own. Look you, Kenneth, there is a dagger in my
      boot. If you would rather have cold steel, 'tis done. It is the last
      service I may render you, and I'll be as gentle as a mistress. Just there,
      over the heart, and you'll know no more until you are in Paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning down the leather of his right boot, he thrust his hand down the
      side of his leg. But Kenneth sprang back with a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he cried, covering his face with his hands. &ldquo;Not that! You don't
      understand. It is death itself I would cheat. What odds to exchange one
      form for another? Is there no way out of this? Is there no way, Sir
      Crispin?&rdquo; he demanded with clenched hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The approach of death makes you maudlin, sir,&rdquo; quoth the other, in whom
      this pitiful show of fear produced a profound disgust. &ldquo;Is there no way;
      say you? There is the window, but 'tis seventy feet above the river; and
      there is the door, but it is locked, and there is a sentry on the other
      side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have known it. I might have known that you would mock me. What is
      death to you, to whom life offers nothing? For you the prospect of it has
      no terrors. But for me&mdash;bethink you, sir, I am scarce eighteen years
      of age,&rdquo; he added brokenly, &ldquo;and life was full of promise for me. O God,
      pity me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, lad, true,&rdquo; the knight returned in softened tones. &ldquo;I had forgotten
      that death is not to you the blessed release that it is to me. And yet,
      and yet,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;do I not die leaving a task unfulfilled&mdash;a task
      of vengeance? And by my soul, I know no greater spur to make a man cling
      to life. Ah,&rdquo; he sighed wistfully, &ldquo;if indeed I could find a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think, Sir Crispin, think,&rdquo; cried the boy feverishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what purpose? There is the window. But even if the bars were moved,
      which I see no manner of accomplishing, the drop to the river is seventy
      feet at least. I measured it with my eyes when first we entered here. We
      have no rope. Your cloak rent in two and the pieces tied together would
      scarce yield us ten feet. Would you care to jump the remaining sixty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the very thought of it the lad trembled, noting which Sir Crispin
      laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There. And yet, boy, it would be taking a risk which if successful would
      mean life&mdash;if otherwise, a speedier end than even the rope will
      afford you. Oddslife,&rdquo; he cried, suddenly springing to his feet, and
      seizing the lanthorn. &ldquo;Let us look at these bars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped across to the window, and held the light so that its rays fell
      full upon the base of the vertical iron that barred the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is much worn by rust, Kenneth,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;The removal of this
      single piece of iron,&rdquo; and he touched the lower arm of the cross, &ldquo;should
      afford us passage. Who knows? Hum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked back to the table and set the lanthorn down. In a tremble,
      Kenneth watched his every movement, but spoke no word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who throws a main,&rdquo; said Galliard, &ldquo;must set a stake upon the board. I
      set my life&mdash;a stake that is already forfeit&mdash;and I throw for
      liberty. If I win, I win all; if I lose, I lose naught. 'Slife, I have
      thrown many a main with Fate, but never one wherein the odds were more
      generous. Come, Kenneth, it is the only way, and we will attempt it if we
      can but move the bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to leap?&rdquo; gasped the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the river. It is the only way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God, I dare not. It is a fearsome drop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Longer, I confess, than they'll give you in an hour's time, if you
      remain; but it may lead elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy's mouth was parched. His eyes burned in their sockets, and yet his
      limbs shook with cold&mdash;but not the cold of that September night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll try it,&rdquo; he muttered with a gulp. Then suddenly clutching Galliard's
      arm, he pointed to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails you now?&rdquo; quoth Crispin testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dawn, Sir Crispin. The dawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin looked, and there, like a gash in the blackness of the heavens, he
      beheld a streak of grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, Sir Crispin; there is no time to lose. The minister said he would
      return at daybreak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him come,&rdquo; answered Galliard grimly, as he moved towards the
      casement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gripped the lower bar with his lean, sinewy hands, and setting his knee
      against the masonry beneath it, he exerted the whole of his huge strength&mdash;that
      awful strength acquired during those years of toil as a galley-slave,
      which even his debaucheries had not undermined. He felt his sinews
      straining until it seemed that they must crack; the sweat stood out upon
      his brow; his breathing grew stertorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gives,&rdquo; he panted at last. &ldquo;It gives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused in his efforts, and withdrew his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must breathe a while. One other effort such as that, and it is done.
      'Fore George,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;it is the first time water has stood my
      friend, for the rains have sadly rusted that iron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without, their sentry was pacing before the door; his steps came nearer,
      passed, and receded; turned, came nigh again, and again passed on. As once
      more they grew faint, Crispin seized the bar and renewed his attempt. This
      time it was easier. Gradually it ceded to the strain Galliard set upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearer came the sentry's footsteps, but they went unheeded by him who
      toiled, and by him who watched with bated breath and beating heart. He
      felt it giving&mdash;giving&mdash;giving. Crack!
    </p>
    <p>
      With a report that rang through the room like a pistol shot, it broke off
      in its socket. Both men caught their breath, and stood for a second
      crouching, with straining ears. The sentry had stopped at their door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galliard was a man of quick action, swift to think, and as swift to
      execute the thought. To thrust Kenneth into a corner, to extinguish the
      light, and to fling himself upon the bed was all the work of an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key grated in the lock, and Crispin answered it with a resounding
      snore. The door opened, and on the threshold stood the Roundhead trooper,
      holding aloft a lanthorn whose rays were flashed back by his polished
      cuirass. He beheld Crispin on the bed with closed eyes and open mouth, and
      he heard his reassuring and melodious snore. He saw Kenneth seated
      peacefully upon the floor, with his back against the wall, and for a
      moment he was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard you aught?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; answered Kenneth, in a strangled voice, &ldquo;I heard something like a
      shot out there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gesture with which he accompanied the words was fatal. Instinctively
      he had jerked his thumb towards the window, thereby drawing the soldier's
      eyes in that direction. The fellow's glance fell upon the twisted bar, and
      a sharp exclamation of surprise escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he been aught but a fool he must have guessed at once how it came so,
      and having guessed it, he must have thought twice ere he ventured within
      reach of a man who could so handle iron. But he was a slow-reasoning clod,
      and so far, thought had not yet taken the place of surprise. He stepped
      into, the chamber and across to the window, that he might more closely
      view that broken bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      With eyes that were full of terror and despair, Kenneth watched him; their
      last hope had failed them. Then, as he looked, it seemed to him that in
      one great leap from his recumbent position on the bed, Crispin had fallen
      upon the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lanthorn was dashed from the fellow's hand, and rolled to Kenneth's
      feet. The fellow had begun' a cry, which broke off suddenly into a gurgle
      as Galliard's fingers closed about his windpipe. He was a big fellow, and
      in his mad struggles he carried: Crispin hither and thither about the
      room. Together: they hurtled against the table, which would have: gone
      crashing over had not Kenneth caught it and drawn it softly to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both men were now upon the bed. Crispin had guessed the soldier's intent
      to fling himself upon the ground so that the ring of his armour might be
      heard, and perchance bring others to his aid. To avoid this, Galliard had
      swung him towards the bed, and hurled him on to it. There he pinned him
      with his knee, and with his fingers he gripped the Roundhead's throat,
      pressing the apple inwards with his thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door, Kenneth!&rdquo; he commanded, in a whisper. &ldquo;Close the door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vain were the trooper's struggles to free himself from that throttling
      grip. Already his efforts grew his face was purple; his veins stood out in
      ropes upon his brow till they seemed upon the point of bursting; his eyes
      protruded like a lobster's and there was a horrible grin upon his mouth;
      still his heels beat the bed, and still he struggled. With his fingers he
      plucked madly at the throttling hands on his neck, and tore at them with
      his nails until the blood streamed from them. Still Galliard held him
      firmly, and with a smile&mdash;a diabolical smile it seemed to the poor,
      half-strangled wretch&mdash;he gazed upon his choking victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone comes!&rdquo; gasped Kenneth suddenly. &ldquo;Someone comes, Sir Crispin!&rdquo; he
      repeated, shaking his hands in a frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galliard listened. Steps were approaching. The soldier heard them also,
      and renewed his efforts. Then Crispin spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why stand you there like a fool?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Quench the light&mdash;stay,
      we may want it! Cast your cloak over it! Quick, man, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steps came nearer. The lad had obeyed him, and they were in darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand by the door,&rdquo; whispered Crispin. &ldquo;Fall upon him as he enters, and
      see that no cry escapes him. Take him by the throat, and as you love your
      life, do not let him get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The footsteps halted. Kenneth crawled softly to his post. The soldier's
      struggles grew of a sudden still, and Crispin released his throat at last.
      Then calmly drawing the fellow's dagger, he felt for the straps of his
      cuirass, and these he proceeded to cut. As he did so the door was opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the light of the lamp burning in the passage they beheld silhouetted
      upon the threshold a black figure crowned by a steeple hat. Then the
      droning voice of the Puritan minister greeted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hour is at hand!&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it time?&rdquo; asked Galliard from the bed. And as he put the question he
      softly thrust aside the trooper's breastplate, and set his hand to the
      fellow's heart. It still beat faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In another hour they will come for you,&rdquo; answered the minister. And
      Crispin marvelled anxiously what Kenneth was about. &ldquo;Repent then,
      miserable sinners, whilst yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off abruptly, awaking out of his religious zeal to a sense of
      strangeness at the darkness and the absence of the sentry, which hitherto
      he had not remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hath&mdash;&rdquo; he began. Then Galliard heard a gasp, followed by the
      noise of a fall, and two struggling men came rolling across the chamber
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravely done, boy!&rdquo; he cried, almost mirthfully. &ldquo;Cling to him, Kenneth;
      cling to him a second yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leapt from the bed, and guided by the faint light coming through the
      door, he sprang across the intervening space and softly closed it. Then he
      groped his way along the wall to the spot where he had seen the lanthorn
      stand when Kenneth had flung his cloak over it. As he went, the two
      striving men came up against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold fast, lad,&rdquo; he cried, encouraging Kenneth, &ldquo;hold him yet a moment,
      and I will relieve you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reached the lanthorn at last, and pulling aside the cloak, he lifted
      the light and set it upon the table.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE BARGAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      By the lanthorn's yellow glare Crispin beheld the two men-a mass of
      writhing bodies and a bunch of waving legs&mdash;upon the ground. Kenneth,
      who was uppermost, clung purposefully to the parson's throat. The faces of
      both were alike distorted, but whilst the lad's breath came in gasping
      hisses, the other's came not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going over to the bed, Crispin drew the unconscious trooper's tuck-sword.
      He paused for a moment to bend over the man's face; his breath came
      faintly, and Crispin knew that ere many moments were sped he would regain
      consciousness. He smiled grimly to see how well he had performed his work
      of suffocation without yet utterly destroying life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sword in hand, he returned to Kenneth and the parson. The Puritan's
      struggles were already becoming mere spasmodic twitchings; his face was as
      ghastly as the trooper's had been a while ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Release him, Kenneth,&rdquo; said Crispin shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He struggles still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Release him, I say,&rdquo; Galliard repeated, and stooping he caught the lad's
      wrist and compelled him to abandon his hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will cry out,&rdquo; exclaimed Kenneth, in apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; laughed Crispin. &ldquo;Leastways, not yet awhile. Observe the
      wretch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With mouth wide agape, the minister lay gasping like a fish newly taken
      from the water. Even now that his throat was free he appeared to struggle
      for a moment before he could draw breath. Then he took it in panting gulps
      until it seemed that he must choke in his gluttony of air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fore George,&rdquo; quoth Crispin, &ldquo;I was no more than in time. Another second,
      and we should have had him, too, unconscious. There, he is recovering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood was receding from the swollen veins of the parson's head, and
      his cheeks were paling to their normal hue. Anon they went yet paler than
      their wont, as Galliard rested the point of his sword against the fellow's
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make sound or movement,&rdquo; said Crispin coldly, &ldquo;and I'll pin you to the
      floor like a beetle. Obey me, and no harm shall come to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will obey you,&rdquo; the fellow answered, in a wheezing whisper. &ldquo;I swear I
      will. But of your charity, good sir, I beseech you remove your sword. Your
      hand might slip, sir,&rdquo; he whined, a wild terror in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where now was the deep bass of his whilom accents? Where now the grotesque
      majesty of his bearing, and the impressive gestures that erstwhile had
      accompanied his words of denunciation?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hand might slip, sir,&rdquo; he whined again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might&mdash;and, by Gad, it shall if I hear more from you. So that you
      are discreet and obedient, have no fear of my hand.&rdquo; Then, still keeping
      his eye upon the fellow: &ldquo;Kenneth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;attend to the crop-ear
      yonder, he will be recovering. Truss him with the bedclothes, and gag him
      with his scarf. See to it, Kenneth, and do it well, but leave his nostrils
      free that he may breathe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth carried out Galliard's orders swiftly and effectively, what time
      Crispin remained standing over the recumbent minister. At length, when
      Kenneth announced that it was done, he bade the Puritan rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have a care,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;or you shall taste the joys of the Paradise
      you preach of. Come, sir parson; afoot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A prey to a fear that compelled unquestioning obedience, the fellow rose
      with alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand there, sir. So,&rdquo; commanded Crispin, his point within an inch of the
      man's Geneva bands. &ldquo;Take your kerchief, Kenneth, and pinion his wrists
      behind him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That done, Crispin bade the lad unbuckle and remove the parson's belt.
      Next he ordered that man of texts to be seated upon their only chair, and
      with that same belt he commanded Kenneth to strap him to it. When at
      length the Puritan was safely bound, Crispin lowered his rapier, and
      seated himself upon the table edge beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir parson,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;let us talk a while. At your first outcry I
      shall hurry you into that future world whither it is your mission to guide
      the souls of others. Maybe you'll find it a better world to preach of than
      to inhabit, and so, for your own sake, I make no doubt you will obey me.
      To your honour, to your good sense and a parson's natural horror of a lie,
      I look for truth in answer to what questions I may set you. Should I find
      you deceiving me, sir, I shall see that your falsehood overtakes you.&rdquo; And
      eloquently raising his blade, he intimated the exact course he would
      adopt. &ldquo;Now, sir, attend to me. How soon are our friends likely to
      discover this topsy-turvydom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they come for you,&rdquo; answered the parson meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how soon, O prophet, will they come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour's time, or thereabout,&rdquo; replied the Puritan, glancing towards
      the window as he spoke. Galliard followed his glance, and observed that
      the light was growing perceptibly stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he commented, &ldquo;in an hour's time there should be light enough to
      hang us by. Is there no chance of anyone coming sooner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None that I can imagine. The only other occupants of the house are a
      party of half a dozen troopers in the guardroom below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the Lord General?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away&mdash;I know not where. But he will be here at sunrise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the sentry that was at our door&mdash;is he not to a changed 'twixt
      this and hanging-time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say for sure, but I think not. The guard was relieved just
      before I came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the men in the guardroom&mdash;answer me truthfully, O Elijah&mdash;what
      manner of watch are they keeping?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, sir, they have drunk enough this night to put a rakehelly Cavalier
      to shame. I was but exhorting them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Kenneth had removed the Puritan's girdle, a small Bible&mdash;such as
      men of his calling were wont to carry&mdash;had dropped out. This Kenneth
      had placed upon the table. Galliard now took it up, and, holding it before
      the Puritan's eyes, he watched him narrowly the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you swear by this book that you have answered nothing but the
      truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a moment's hesitation the parson pledged his oath, that, to the
      best of his belief, he had answered accurately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well, sir. And now, though it grieve me to cause you some slight
      discomfort, I must ensure your silence, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, placing his sword upon the table, he passed behind the Puritan, and
      taking the man's own scarf, he effectively gagged him with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Kenneth,&rdquo; said he, turning to the lad. Then he stopped abruptly as
      if smitten by a sudden thought. Presently&mdash;&ldquo;Kenneth,&rdquo; he continued in
      a different tone, &ldquo;a while ago I mind me you said that were your liberty
      restored you, you would join hands with me in punishing the evildoers who
      wrecked my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, Sir Crispin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the knight paused. It was a vile thing that he was about to
      do, he told himself, and as he realized how vile, his impulse was to say
      no more; to abandon the suddenly formed project and to trust to his own
      unaided wits and hands. But as again he thought of the vast use this lad
      would be to him&mdash;this lad who was the betrothed of Cynthia Ashburn&mdash;he
      saw that the matter was not one hastily to be judged and dismissed.
      Carefully he weighed it in the balance of his mind. On the one hand was
      the knowledge that did they succeed in making good their escape, Kenneth
      would naturally fly for shelter to his friends the Ashburns&mdash;the
      usurpers of Castle Marleigh. What then more natural than his taking with
      him the man who had helped him to escape, and who shared his own danger of
      recapture? And with so plausible a motive for admission to Castle
      Marleigh, how easy would not his vengeance become? He might at first wean
      himself into their good graces, and afterwards&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before his mental eyes there unfolded itself the vista of a great revenge;
      one that should be worthy of him, and commensurate with the foul deed that
      called for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the other scale the treacherous flavour of this method weighed heavily.
      He proposed to bind the lad to a promise, the shape of whose fulfilment he
      would withhold&mdash;a promise the lad would readily give, and yet, one
      that he must sooner die than enter into, did he but know what manner of
      fulfilment would be exacted. It amounted to betraying the lad into a
      betrayal of his friends&mdash;the people of his future wife. Whatever the
      issue for Crispin, 'twas odds Kenneth's prospect of wedding this Cynthia
      would be blighted for all time by the action into which Galliard proposed
      to thrust him all unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      So stood the case in Galliard's mind, and the scales fell now on one side,
      now on the other. But against his scruples rose the memory of the
      treatment which the lad had meted out to him that night; the harshness of
      the boy's judgment; the irrevocable contempt wherein he had clearly seen
      that he was held by this fatuous milksop. All this aroused his rancour
      now, and steeled his heart against the voice of honour. What was this boy
      to him, he asked himself, that he should forego for him the accomplishing
      of his designs? How had this lad earned any consideration from him? What
      did he owe him? Naught! Still, he would not decide in haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of the man whom Kenneth held to be destitute of all
      honourable principles, to stand thus in the midst of perils, when every
      second that sped lessened their chances of escape, turning over in his
      mind calmly and collectedly a point of conduct. It was in his passions
      only that Crispin was ungovernable, in violence only that he was swift&mdash;in
      all things else was he deliberate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this Kenneth had now a proof that set him quaking with impatient fear.
      Anxiously, his hands clenched and his face pale, he watched his companion,
      who stood with brows knit in thought, and his grey eyes staring at the
      ground. At length he could brook that, to him, incomprehensible and mad
      delay no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Crispin,&rdquo; he whispered, plucking at his sleeve; &ldquo;Sir Crispin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knight flashed him a glance that was almost of anger. Then the fire
      died out of his eyes; he sighed and spoke. In that second's glance he had
      seen the lad's face; the fear and impatience written on it had disgusted
      him, and caused the scales to fall suddenly and definitely against the
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking how it might be accomplished,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is but one way,&rdquo; cried the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, there are two, and I wish to choose carefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you delay your choice much longer, none will be left you,&rdquo; cried
      Kenneth impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noting the lad's growing fears, and resolved now upon his course, Galliard
      set himself to play upon them until terror should render the boy as wax in
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There speaks your callow inexperience,&rdquo; said he, with a pitying smile.
      &ldquo;When you shall have lived as long as I have done, and endured as much;
      when you shall have set your wits to the saving of your life as often as
      have I&mdash;you will have learnt that haste is fatal to all enterprises.
      Failure means the forfeiture of something; tonight it would mean the
      forfeiture of our lives, and it were a pity to let such good efforts as
      these&rdquo;&mdash;and with a wave of the hand he indicated their two captors&mdash;&ldquo;go
      wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Kenneth, well-nigh beside himself, &ldquo;if you come not with
      me, I go alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither?&rdquo; asked Crispin dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galliard bowed slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fare you well, sir. I'll not detain you. Your way is clear, and it is for
      you to choose between the door and the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that Crispin turned his back upon his companion and crossed to
      the bed, where the trooper lay glaring in mute anger. He stooped, and
      unbuckling the soldier's swordbelt&mdash;to which the scabbard was
      attached&mdash;he girt himself with it. Without raising his eyes, and
      keeping his back to Kenneth, who stood between him and the door, he went
      next to the table, and, taking up the sword that he had left there, he
      restored it to the sheath. As the hilt clicked against the mouth of the
      scabbard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Sir Crispin!&rdquo; cried the lad. &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galliard wheeled sharply round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? Not gone yet?&rdquo; said he sardonically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not,&rdquo; the lad confessed. &ldquo;I dare not go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galliard laughed softly; then suddenly waxed grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ere we go, Master Kenneth, I would again remind you of your assurance
      that were we to regain our liberty you would aid me in the task of
      vengeance that lies before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once already have I answered you that it is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, are you still of the same mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, I am! Anything, Sir Crispin; anything so that you come away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so fast, Kenneth. The promise that I shall ask of you is not to be so
      lightly given. If we escape I may fairly claim to have saved your life,
      'twixt what I have done and what I may yet do. Is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I acknowledge it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir, in payment I shall expect your aid hereafter to help me in
      that which I must accomplish, that which the hope of accomplishing is the
      only spur to my own escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have my promise!&rdquo; cried the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not give it lightly, Kenneth,&rdquo; said Crispin gravely. &ldquo;It may cause you
      much discomfort, and may be fraught with danger even to your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galliard bowed his head; then, turning, he took the Bible from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your hand upon this book, by your honour, your faith, and your every
      hope of salvation, swear that if I bear you alive out of this house you
      will devote yourself to me and to my task of vengeance until it shall be
      accomplished or until I perish; swear that you will set aside all personal
      matters and inclinations of your own, to serve me when I shall call upon
      you. Swear that, and, in return, I will give my life if need be to save
      yours to-night, in which case you will be released from your oath without
      more ado.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lad paused a moment. Crispin was so impressive, the oath he imposed so
      solemn, that for an instant the boy hesitated. His cautious, timid nature
      whispered to him that perchance he should know more of this matter ere he
      bound himself so irrevocably. But Crispin, noting the hesitation, stifled
      it by appealing to the lad's fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Resolve yourself,&rdquo; he exclaimed abruptly. &ldquo;It grows light, and the time
      for haste is come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear!&rdquo; answered Kenneth, overcome by his impatience. &ldquo;I swear, by my
      honour, my faith, and my every hope of heaven to lend you my aid, when and
      how you may demand it, until your task be accomplished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin took the Bible from the boy's hands, and replaced it on the table.
      His lips were pressed tight, and he avoided the lad's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not find me wanting in my part of the bargain,&rdquo; he muttered, as
      he took up the soldier's cloak and hat. &ldquo;Come, take that parson's steeple
      hat and his cloak, and let us be going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed to the door, and opening it he peered down the passage. A
      moment he stood listening. All was still. Then he turned again. In the
      chamber the steely light of the breaking day was rendering more yellow
      still the lanthorn's yellow flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fare you well, sir parson,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Forgive me the discomfort I have
      been forced to put upon you, and pray for the success of our escape.
      Commend me to Oliver of the ruby nose. Fare you well, sir. Come, Kenneth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held the door for the lad to pass out. As they stood in the dimly
      lighted passage he closed it softly after them, and turned the key in the
      lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said again, and led the way to the stairs, Kenneth tiptoeing
      after him with wildly beating heart.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE ESCAPE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Treading softly, and with ears straining for the slightest sound, the two
      men descended to the first floor of the house. They heard nothing to alarm
      them as they crept down, and not until they paused on the first landing to
      reconnoitre did they even catch the murmur of voices issuing from the
      guardroom below. So muffled was the sound that Crispin guessed how matters
      stood even before he had looked over the balusters into the hall beneath.
      The faint grey of the dawn was the only light that penetrated the gloom of
      that pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Fates are kind, Kenneth,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Those fools sit with closed
      doors. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Kenneth laid his hand upon Galliard's sleeve. &ldquo;What if the door should
      open as we pass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone will die,&rdquo; muttered Crispin back. &ldquo;But pray God that it may not.
      We must run the risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no other way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; returned Galliard sardonically, &ldquo;we can linger here until we
      are taken. But, oddslife, I'm not so minded. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he spoke he drew the lad along.
    </p>
    <p>
      His foot was upon the topmost stair of the flight, when of a sudden the
      stillness of the house was broken by a loud knock upon the street door.
      Instantly&mdash;as though they had been awaiting it there was a stir of
      feet below and the bang of an overturned chair; then a shaft of yellow
      light fell athwart the darkness of the hall as the guardroom door was
      opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back!&rdquo; growled Galliard. &ldquo;Back, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were but in time. Peering over the balusters they saw two troopers
      pass out of the guardroom, and cross the hall to the door. A bolt was
      drawn and a chain rattled, then followed the creak of hinges, and on the
      stone flags rang the footsteps and the jingling of spurs of those that
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is all well?&rdquo; came a voice, which Crispin recognized as Colonel Pride's,
      followed by an affirmative reply from one of the soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hath a minister visited the malignants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Toneleigh is with them even now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the hall Crispin could now make out the figures of Colonel Pride and of
      three men who came with him. But he had scant leisure to survey them, for
      the colonel was in haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sirs,&rdquo; he heard him say, &ldquo;light me to their garret. I would see
      them&mdash;leastways, one of them, before he dies. They are to hang where
      the Moabites hanged Gives yesterday. Had I my way... But, there lead on,
      fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; gasped Kenneth, as the soldier set foot upon the stairs. Under
      his breath Crispin swore a terrific oath. For an instant it seemed to him
      there was naught left but to stand there and await recapture. Through his
      mind it flashed that they were five, and he but one; for his companion was
      unarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that swiftness which thought alone can compass did he weigh the odds,
      and judge his chances. He realized how desperate they were did he remain,
      and even as he thought he glanced sharply round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dim indeed was the light, but his sight was keen, and quickened by the
      imminence of danger. Partly his eyes and partly his instinct told him that
      not six paces behind him there must be a door, and if Heaven pleased it
      should be unlocked, behind it they must look for shelter. It even crossed
      his mind in that second of crowding, galloping thought, that perchance the
      room might be occupied. That was a risk he must take&mdash;the lesser risk
      of the two, the choice of one of which was forced upon him. He had
      determined all this ere the soldier's foot was upon the third step of the
      staircase, and before the colonel had commenced the ascent. Kenneth stood
      palsied with fear, gazing like one fascinated at the approaching peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then upon his ear fell the fierce whisper: &ldquo;Come with me, and tread
      lightly as you love your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In three long strides, and by steps that were softer than a cat's, Crispin
      crossed to the door which he had rather guessed than seen. He ran his hand
      along until he caught the latch. Softly he tried it; it gave, and the door
      opened. Kenneth was by then beside him. He paused to look back.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the opposite wall the light of the trooper's lanthorn fell brightly.
      Another moment and the fellow would have reached and turned the corner of
      the stairs, and his light must reveal them to him. But ere that instant
      was passed Crispin had drawn his companion through, and closed the door as
      softly as he had opened it. The chamber was untenanted and almost bare of
      furniture, at which discovery Crispin breathed more freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood there, and heard the ascending footsteps, and the clank-clank
      of a sword against the stair-rail. A bar of yellow light came under the
      door that sheltered them. Stronger it grew and farther it crept along the
      floor; then stopped and receded again, as he who bore the lanthorn turned
      and began to climb to the second floor. An instant later and the light had
      vanished, eclipsed by those who followed in the fellow's wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The window, Sir Crispin,&rdquo; cried Kenneth, in an excited whisper&mdash;&ldquo;the
      window!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Crispin calmly. &ldquo;The drop is a long one, and we should but
      light in the streets, and be little better than we are here. Wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He listened. The footsteps had turned the corner leading to the floor
      above. He opened the door, partly at first, then wide. For an instant he
      stood listening again. The steps were well overhead by now; soon they
      would mount the last flight, and then discovery must be swift to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; was all Crispin said, and, drawing his sword he led the way
      swiftly, yet cautiously, to the stairs once more. In passing he glanced
      over the rails. The guardroom door stood ajar, and he caught the murmurs
      of subdued conversation. But he did not pause. Had the door stood wide he
      would not have paused then. There was not a second to be lost; to wait was
      to increase the already overwhelming danger. Cautiously, and leaning well
      upon the stout baluster, he began the descent. Kenneth followed him
      mechanically, with white face and a feeling of suffocation in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      They gained the corner, and turning, they began what was truly the
      perilous part of their journey. Not more than a dozen steps were there;
      but at the bottom stood the guardroom door, and through the chink of its
      opening a shaft of light fell upon the nethermost step. Once a stair
      creaked, and to their quickened senses it sounded like a pistol-shot. As
      loud to Crispin sounded the indrawn breath of apprehension from Kenneth
      that followed it. He had almost paused to curse the lad when, thinking him
      of how time pressed, he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within three steps of the bottom were they, and they could almost
      distinguish what was being said in the room, when Crispin stopped, and
      turning his head to attract Kenneth's attention, he pointed straight
      across the hall to a dimly visible door. It was that of the chamber
      wherein he had been brought before Cromwell. Its position had occurred to
      him some moments before, and he had determined then upon going that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad followed the indication of his finger, and signified by a nod that
      he understood. Another step Galliard descended; then from the guardroom
      came a loud yawn, to send the boy cowering against the wall. It was
      followed by the sound of someone rising; a chair grated upon the floor,
      and there was a movement of feet within the chamber. Had Kenneth been
      alone, of a certainty terror would have frozen him to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the calm, unmovable Crispin proceeded as if naught had chanced; he
      argued that even if he who had risen were coming towards the door, there
      was nothing to be gained by standing still. Their only chance lay now in
      passing before it might be opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      They that walk through perils in a brave man's company cannot but gain
      confidence from the calm of his demeanour. So was it now with Kenneth. The
      steady onward march of that tall, lank figure before him drew him
      irresistibly after it despite his tremors. And well it was for him that
      this was so. They gained the bottom of the staircase at length; they stood
      beside the door of the guardroom, they passed it in safety. Then slowly&mdash;painfully
      slowly&mdash;to avoid their steps from ringing upon the stone floor, they
      crept across towards the door that meant safety to Sir Crispin. Slowly,
      step by step, they moved, and with every stride Crispin looked behind him,
      prepared to rush the moment he had sign they were discovered. But it was
      not needed. In silence and in safety they were permitted to reach the
      door. To Crispin's joy it was unfastened. Quietly he opened it, then with
      calm gallantry he motioned to his companion to go first, holding it for
      him as he passed in, and keeping watch with eye and ear the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarce had Kenneth entered the chamber when from above came the sound of
      loud and excited voices, announcing to them that their flight was at last
      discovered. It was responded to by a rush of feet in the guardroom, and
      Crispin had but time to dart in after his companion and close the door ere
      the troopers poured out into the hall and up the stairs, with confused
      shouts that something must be amiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the room that sheltered him Crispin chuckled, as he ran his hand
      along the edge of the door until he found the bolt, and softly shot it
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Slife,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;'twas a close thing! Aye, shout, you cuckolds,&rdquo; he
      went on. &ldquo;Yell yourselves hoarse as the crows you are! You'll hang us
      where Gives are hanged, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth tugged at the skirts of his doublet. &ldquo;What now?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Crispin, &ldquo;we'll leave by the window, if it please you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the room, and a moment or two later they had dropped on to
      the narrow railed pathway overlooking the river, which Crispin had
      observed from their prison window the evening before. He had observed,
      too, that a small boat was moored at some steps about a hundred yards
      farther down the stream, and towards that spot he now sped along the
      footpath, followed closely by Kenneth. The path sloped in that direction,
      so that by the time the spot was reached the water flowed not more than
      six feet or so beneath them. Half a dozen steps took them down this to the
      moorings of that boat, which fortunately had not been removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get in, Kenneth,&rdquo; Crispin commanded. &ldquo;There, I'll take the oars, and I'll
      keep under shelter of the bank lest those blunderers should bethink them
      of looking out of our prison window. Oddswounds, Kenneth, I am hungry as a
      wolf, and as dry&mdash;ough, as dry as Dives when he begged for a sup of
      water. Heaven send we come upon some good malignant homestead ere we go
      far, where a Christian may find a meal and a stoup of ale. 'Tis a miracle
      I had strength enough to crawl downstairs. Swounds, but an empty stomach
      is a craven comrade in a desperate enterprise. Hey! Have a care, boy. Now,
      sink me if this milksop hasn't fainted!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE ASHBURNS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Gregory Ashburn pushed back his chair and made shift to rise from the
      table at which he and his brother had but dined.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tall, heavily built man, with a coarse, florid countenance set in
      a frame of reddish hair that hung straight and limp. In the colour of
      their hair lay the only point of resemblance between the brothers. For the
      rest Joseph was spare and of middle weight, pale of face, thin-lipped, and
      owning a cunning expression that was rendered very evil by virtue of the
      slight cast in his colourless eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In earlier life Gregory had not been unhandsome; debauchery and sloth had
      puffed and coarsened him. Joseph, on the other hand, had never been aught
      but ill-favoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis a week since Worcester field was fought,&rdquo; grumbled Gregory, looking
      lazily sideways at the mullioned windows as he spoke, &ldquo;and never a word
      from the lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph shrugged his narrow shoulders and sneered. It was Joseph's habit to
      sneer when he spoke, and his words were wont to fit the sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doth the lack of news trouble you?&rdquo; he asked, glancing across the table
      at his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory rose without meeting that glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truth to tell it does trouble me,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; quoth Joseph, &ldquo;tis a natural thing enough. When battles are
      fought it is not uncommon for men to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregory crossed slowly to the window, and stared out at the trees of the
      park which autumn was fast stripping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he were among the fallen&mdash;if he were dead then indeed the matter
      would be at an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, and well ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget Cynthia,&rdquo; Gregory reproved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget her? Not I, man. Listen.&rdquo; And he jerked his thumb in the direction
      of the wainscot.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the two men in that rich chamber of Castle Marleigh was borne the sound&mdash;softened
      by distance of a girlish voice merrily singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph laughed a cackle of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the song of a maid whose lover comes not back from the wars?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But bethink you, Joseph, the child suspects not the possibility of his
      having fallen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gadswounds, sir, did your daughter give the fellow a thought she must be
      anxious. A week yesterday since the battle, and no word from him. I dare
      swear, Gregory, there's little in that to warrant his mistress singing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia is young&mdash;a child. She reasons not as you and I, nor seeks
      to account for his absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troubles not to account for it,&rdquo; Joseph amended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; returned Gregory irritably, &ldquo;I would I knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That which we do not know we may sometimes infer. I infer him to be dead,
      and there's the end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if he should not be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my good fool, he would be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unlike you, Joseph, to argue so loosely. What if he should be a
      prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, the plantations will do that which the battle hath left
      undone. So that, dead or captive, you see it is all one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, lifting his glass to the light, he closed one eye, the better to
      survey with the other the rich colour of the wine. Not that Joseph was
      curious touching that colour, but he was a juggler in gestures, and at
      that moment he could think of no other whereby he might so naturally
      convey the utter indifference of his feelings in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph, you are wrong,&rdquo; said Gregory, turning his back upon the window
      and facing his brother. &ldquo;It is not all one. What if he return some day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what if&mdash;what if&mdash;what if!&rdquo; cried Joseph testily. &ldquo;Gregory,
      what a casuist you might have been had not nature made you a villain! You
      are as full of &ldquo;what if s&rdquo; as an egg of meat. Well what if some day he
      should return? I fling your question back&mdash;what if?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God only knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then leave it to Him,&rdquo; was the flippant answer; and Joseph drained his
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, brother, 'twere too great a risk. I must and I will know whether
      Kenneth were slain or not. If he is a prisoner, then we must exert
      ourselves to win his freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plague take it,&rdquo; Joseph burst out. &ldquo;Why all this ado? Why did you ever
      loose that graceless whelp from his Scottish moor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregory sighed with an air of resigned patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have more reasons than one,&rdquo; he answered slowly. &ldquo;If you need that I
      recite them to you, I pity your wits. Look you, Joseph, you have more
      influence with Cromwell; more&mdash;far more&mdash;than have I, and if you
      are minded to do so, you can serve me in this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wait but to learn how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go to Cromwell, at Windsor or wherever he may be, and seek to learn
      from him if Kenneth is a prisoner. If he is not, then clearly he is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph made a gesture of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you not leave Fate alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think you I have no conscience, Joseph?&rdquo; cried the other with sudden
      vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pish! you are womanish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Joseph, I am old. I am in the autumn of my days, and I would see
      these two wed before I die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are damned for a croaking, maudlin' craven,&rdquo; added Joseph. &ldquo;Pah! You
      make me sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence, during which the brothers eyed each other,
      Gregory with a sternness before which Joseph's mocking eye was forced at
      length to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph, you shall go to the Lord General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Joseph weakly, &ldquo;we will say that I go. But if Kenneth be a
      prisoner, what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must beg his liberty from Cromwell. He will not refuse you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he not? I am none so confident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can make the attempt, and leastways we shall have some definite
      knowledge of what has befallen the boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The which definite knowledge seems to me none so necessary. Moreover,
      Gregory, bethink you; there has been a change, and the wind carries an
      edge that will arouse every devil of rheumatism in my bones. I am not a
      lad, Gregory, and travelling at this season is no small matter for a man
      of fifty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregory approached the table, and leaning his hand upon it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go?&rdquo; he asked, squarely eyeing his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph fell a-pondering. He knew Gregory to be a man of fixed ideas, and
      he bethought him that were he now to refuse he would be hourly plagued by
      Gregory's speculations touching the boy's fate and recriminations touching
      his own selfishness. On the other hand, however, the journey daunted him.
      He was not a man to sacrifice his creature comforts, and to be asked to
      sacrifice them to a mere whim, a shadow, added weight to his inclination
      to refuse the undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you have the matter so much at heart,&rdquo; said he at length, &ldquo;does it
      not occur to you that you could plead with greater fervour, and be the
      likelier to succeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that Cromwell will lend a more willing ear to you than to me&mdash;perchance
      because you know so well upon occasion how to weave your stock of texts
      into your discourse,&rdquo; he added with a sneer. &ldquo;Will you go, Joseph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bethink you that we know not where he is. I may have to wander for weeks
      o'er the face of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go?&rdquo; Gregory repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a pox on it,&rdquo; broke out Joseph, rising suddenly. &ldquo;I'll go since
      naught else will quiet you. I'll start to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph, I am grateful. I shall be more grateful yet if you will start
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sink me, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sink me, yes,&rdquo; returned Gregory. &ldquo;You must, Joseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph spoke of the wind again; the sky, he urged, was heavy with rain.
      &ldquo;What signifies a day?&rdquo; he whined.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gregory stood his ground until almost out of self-protection the other
      consented to do his bidding and set out as soon as he could make ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being determined, Joseph left his brother, and cursing Master Stewart
      for the amount of discomfort which he was about to endure on his behoof,
      he went to prepare for the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory lingered still in the chamber where they had dined, and sat
      staring moodily before him at the table-linen. Anon, with a half-laugh of
      contempt, he filled a glass of muscadine, and drained it. As he set down
      the glass the door opened, and on the threshold stood a very dainty girl,
      whose age could not be more than twenty. Gregory looked on the fresh, oval
      face, with its wealth of brown hair crowning the low, broad forehead, and
      told himself that in his daughter he had just cause for pride. He looked
      again, and told himself that his brother was right; she had not the air of
      a maid whose lover returns not from the wars. Her lips were smiling, and
      the eyes&mdash;low-lidded and blue as the heavens&mdash;were bright with
      mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why sit you there so glum,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;whilst my uncle, they tell me, is
      going on a journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregory was minded to put her feelings to the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kenneth,&rdquo; he replied with significant emphasis, watching her closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mirth faded from her eyes, and they took on a grave expression that
      added to their charm. But Gregory had looked for fear, leastways deep
      concern, and in this he was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of him, father?&rdquo; she asked, approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naught, and that's the rub. It is time we had news, and as none comes,
      your uncle goes to seek it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think you that ill can have befallen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregory was silent a moment, weighing his answer. Then
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hope not, sweetheart,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He may be a prisoner. We last had
      news of him from Worcester, and 'tis a week and more since the battle was
      fought there. Should he be a captive, your uncle has sufficient influence
      to obtain his enlargement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia sighed, and moved towards the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Kenneth,&rdquo; she murmured gently. &ldquo;He may be wounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall soon learn,&rdquo; he answered. His disappointment grew keener; where
      he had looked for grief he found no more than an expression of pitying
      concern. Nor was his disappointment lessened when, after a spell of
      thoughtful silence, she began to comment upon the condition of the trees
      in the park below. Gregory had it in his mind to chide her for this lack
      of interest in the fate of her intended husband, but he let the impulse
      pass unheeded. After all, if Kenneth lived she should marry him. Hitherto
      she had been docile and willing enough to be guided by him; she had even
      displayed a kindness for Kenneth; no doubt she would do so again when
      Joseph returned with him&mdash;unless he were among the Worcester slain,
      in which case, perhaps, it would prove best that his fate was not to cause
      her any prostration of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sky is heavy, father,&rdquo; said Cynthia from the window. &ldquo;Poor uncle! He
      will have rough weather for his journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rejoice that someone wastes pity on poor uncle,&rdquo; growled Joseph, who
      re-entered, &ldquo;this uncle whom your father drives out of doors in all
      weathers to look for his daughter's truant lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia smiled upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is heroic of you, uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;I shall do my best to find the laggard, lest
      those pretty eyes should weep away their beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregory's glance reproved this sneer of Joseph's, whereupon Joseph drew
      close to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broken-hearted, is she not?&rdquo; he muttered, to which Gregory returned no
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, as Joseph climbed into his saddle, he turned to his brother
      again, and directing his eyes upon the girl, who stood patting the glossy
      neck of his nag:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you see that matters are as I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; replied Gregory sternly, &ldquo;I hope to see you return with the
      boy. It will be better so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph shrugged his shoulders contemptuously. Then, taking leave of his
      brother and his niece, he rode out with two grooms at his heels, and took
      the road South.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. THE HOUSE THAT WAS ROLAND MARLEIGH'S
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was high noon next day, and Gregory Ashburn was taking the air upon the
      noble terrace of Castle Marleigh, when the beat of hoofs, rapidly
      approaching up the avenue, arrested his attention. He stopped in his walk,
      and, turning, sought to discover who came. His first thought was of his
      brother; his second, of Kenneth. Through the half-denuded trees he made
      out two mounted figures, riding side by side; and from the fact of there
      being two, he adduced that this could not be Joseph returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as he waited he was joined by Cynthia, who took her stand beside him,
      and voiced the inquiry that was in his mind. But her father could no more
      than answer that he hoped it might be Kenneth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the horsemen passed from behind the screen of trees and came into the
      clearing before the terrace, and unto the waiting glances of Ashburn and
      his daughter was revealed a curiously bedraggled and ill-assorted pair.
      The one riding slightly in advance looked like a Puritan of the meaner
      sort, in his battered steeple-hat and cloak of rusty black. The other was
      closely wrapped in a red mantle, uptilted behind by a sword of prodigious
      length, and for all that his broad, grey hat was unadorned by any feather,
      it was set at a rakish, ruffling, damn-me angle that pronounced him no
      likely comrade for the piously clad youth beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But beneath that brave red cloak&mdash;alack!&mdash;as was presently seen
      when they dismounted, that gentleman was in a sorry plight. He wore a
      leather jerkin, so cut and soiled that any groom might have disdained it;
      a pair of green breeches, frayed to their utmost; and coarse boots of
      untanned leather, adorned by rusty spurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the terrace Gregory paused a moment to call his groom to attend the
      new-comers, then he passed down the steps to greet Kenneth with boisterous
      effusion. Behind him, slow and stately as a woman of twice her years, came
      Cynthia. Calm was her greeting of her lover, contained in courteous
      expressions of pleasure at beholding him safe, and suffering him to kiss
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the background, his sable locks uncovered out of deference to the lady,
      stood Sir Crispin, his face pale and haggard, his lips parted, and his
      grey eyes burning as they fell again, after the lapse of years, upon the
      stones of this his home&mdash;the castle to which he was now come, hat in
      hand, to beg for shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory was speaking, his hands resting upon Kenneth's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been much exercised concerning you, lad,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;We
      almost feared the worst, and yesterday Joseph left us to seek news of you
      at Cromwell's hands. Where have you tarried?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anon, sir; you shall learn anon. The story is a long one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; you will be tired, and perchance you would first rest a while.
      Cynthia will see to it. But what scarecrow have you there? What
      tatterdemalion is this?&rdquo; he cried, pointing to Galliard. He had imagined
      him a servant, but the dull flush that overspread Sir Crispin's face told
      him of his error.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have you know, sir,&rdquo; Crispin began, with some heat, when Kenneth
      interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis to this gentleman, sir, that I owe my presence here. He was my
      fellow-prisoner, and but for his quick wit and stout arm I should be stiff
      by now. Anon, sir, you shall hear the story of it, and I dare swear it
      will divert you. This gentleman is Sir Crispin Galliard, lately a captain
      of horse with whom I served in Middleton's Brigade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin bowed low, conscious of the keen scrutiny in which Gregory's eyes
      were bent upon him. In his heart there arose a fear that, haply after all,
      the years that were sped had not wrought sufficient change in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Crispin Galliard,&rdquo; Ashburn was saying, after the manner of one who is
      searching his memory. &ldquo;Galliard, Galliard&mdash;not he whom they called
      'Rakehelly Galliard,' and who gave us such trouble in the late King's
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin breathed once more. Ashburn's scrutiny was explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same, sir,&rdquo; he answered, with a smile and a fresh bow. &ldquo;Your servant,
      sir; and yours, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia looked with interest at the lank, soldierly figure. She, too, had
      heard&mdash;as who had not?&mdash;wild stories of this man's achievements.
      But of no feat of his had she been told that could rival that of his
      escape from Worcester; and when, that same evening, Kenneth related it, as
      they supped, her low-lidded eyes grew very wide, and as they fell on
      Crispin, admiration had taken now the place of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romance swayed as great a portion of her heart as it does of most women's.
      She loved the poets and their songs of great deeds; and here was one who,
      in the light of that which they related of him, was like an incarnation of
      some hero out of a romancer's ballad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth she never yet had held in over high esteem; but of a sudden, in
      the presence of this harsh-featured dog of war, this grim, fierce-eyed
      ruffler, he seemed to fade, despite his comeliness of face and form, into
      a poor and puny insignificance. And when, presently, he unwisely related
      how, when in the boat he had fainted, the maiden laughed outright for very
      scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this plain expression of contempt, her father shot her a quick, uneasy
      glance. Kenneth stopped short, bringing his narrative abruptly to a close.
      Reproachfully he looked at her, turning first red, then white, as anger
      chased annoyance through his soul. Galliard looked on with quiet relish;
      her laugh had contained that which for days he had carried in his heart.
      He drained his bumper slowly, and made no attempt to relieve the awkward
      silence that sat upon the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truth to tell, there was emotion enough in the soul of him who was wont to
      be the life of every board he sat at to hold him silent and even moody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, after eighteen years, was he again in his ancestral home of
      Marleigh. But how was he returned? As one who came under a feigned name,
      to seek from usurping hands a shelter 'neath his own roof; a beggar of
      that from others which it should have been his to grant or to deny those
      others. As an avenger he came. For justice he came, and armed with
      retribution; the flame of a hate unspeakable burning in his heart, and
      demanding the lives&mdash;no less&mdash;of those that had destroyed him
      and his. Yet was he forced to sit a mendicant almost at that board whose
      head was his by every right; forced to sit and curb his mood, giving no
      outward sign of the volcano that boiled and raged within his soul as his
      eye fell upon the florid, smiling face and portly, well-fed frame of
      Gregory Ashburn. For the time was not yet. He must wait; wait until
      Joseph's return, so that he might spend his vengeance upon both together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patient had he been for eighteen years, confident that ere he died, a just
      and merciful God would give him this for which he lived and waited. Yet
      now that the season was at hand; now upon the very eve of that for which
      he had so long been patient, a frenzy of impatience fretted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drank deep that night, and through deep drinking his manner thawed&mdash;for
      in his cups it was not his to be churlish to friend or foe. Anon Cynthia
      withdrew; next Kenneth, who went in quest of her. Still Crispin sat on,
      and drank his host's health above his breath, and his perdition under it,
      till in the end Gregory, who never yet had found his master at the bottle,
      grew numb and drowsy, and sat blinking at the tapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until midnight they remained at table, talking of this and that, and each
      understanding little of what the other said. As the last hour of night
      boomed out through the great hall, Gregory spoke of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do I lie to-night?&rdquo; asked Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the northern wing,&rdquo; answered Gregory with a hiccough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sir, I protest,&rdquo; cried Galliard, struggling to his feet, and swaying
      somewhat as he stood. &ldquo;I'll sleep in the King's chamber, none other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The King's chamber?&rdquo; echoed Gregory, and his face showed the confused
      struggles of his brain. &ldquo;What know you of the King's chamber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it faces the east and the sea, and that it is the chamber I love
      best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you know of it since, I take it, you have never seen it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not?&rdquo; he began, in a voice that was awful in its threatening calm.
      Then, recollecting himself, and shaking some of the drunkenness from him:
      &ldquo;In the old days, when the Marleighs were masters here,&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;I
      was often within these walls. Roland Marleigh was my friend. The King's
      chamber was ever accorded me, and there, for old time's sake, I'll lay
      these old bones of mine to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were Roland Marleigh's friend?&rdquo; gasped Gregory. He was very white
      now, and there was a sheen of moisture on his face. The sound of that name
      had well-nigh sobered him. It was almost as if the ghost of Roland
      Marleigh stood before him. His knees were loosened, and he sank back into
      the chair from which he had but risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, I was his friend!&rdquo; assented Crispin. &ldquo;Poor Roland! He married your
      sister, did he not, and it was thus that, having no issue and the family
      being extinct, Castle Marleigh passed to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He married our cousin,&rdquo; Gregory amended. &ldquo;They were an ill-fated family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill-fated, indeed, an all accounts be true,&rdquo; returned Crispin in a
      maudlin voice. &ldquo;Poor Roland! Well, for old time's sake, I'll sleep in the
      King's chamber, Master Ashburn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall sleep where you list, sir,&rdquo; answered Gregory, and they rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you look to honour us long at Castle Marleigh, Sir Crispin?&rdquo; was
      Gregory's last question before separating from his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sir, 'tis likely I shall go hence to-morrow,&rdquo; answered Crispin,
      unmindful of what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust not,&rdquo; said Gregory, in accents of relief that belied him. &ldquo;A
      friend of Roland Marleigh's must ever be welcome in the house that was
      Roland Marleigh's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house that was Roland Marleigh's,&rdquo; Crispin muttered. &ldquo;Heigho! Life is
      precarious as the fall of a die at best an ephemeral business. To-night
      you say the house that was Roland Marleigh's; presently men will be saying
      the house that the Ashburns lived&mdash;aye, and died&mdash;in. Give you
      good night, Master Ashburn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He staggered off, and stumbled up the broad staircase at the head of which
      a servant now awaited, taper in hand, to conduct him to the chamber he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory followed him with a dull, frightened eye. Galliard's halting,
      thickly uttered words had sounded like a prophecy in his ears.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. THE METAMORPHOSIS OF KENNETH
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the morrow came, however, Sir Crispin showed no signs of carrying out
      his proposal of the night before, and departing from Castle Marleigh. Nor,
      indeed, did he so much as touch upon the subject, bearing himself rather
      as one whose sojourn there was to be indefinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory offered no comment upon this; through what he had done for Kenneth
      they were under a debt to Galliard, and whilst he was a fugitive from the
      Parliament's justice it would ill become Gregory to hasten his departure.
      Moreover, Gregory recalled little or nothing of the words that had passed
      between them in their cups, save a vague memory that Crispin had said that
      he had once known Roland Marleigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth was content that Galliard should lie idle, and not call upon him
      to go forth again to lend him the aid he had pledged himself to render
      when Crispin should demand it. He marvelled, as the days wore on, that
      Galliard should appear to have forgotten that task of his, and that he
      should make no shift to set about it. For the rest, however, it troubled
      him but little; enough preoccupation did he find in Cynthia's daily
      increasing coldness. Upon all the fine speeches that he made her she
      turned an idle ear, or if she replied at all it was but petulantly to
      interrupt them, to call him a man of great words and small deeds. All that
      he did she found ill done, and told him of it. His sober, godly garments
      of sombre hue afforded her the first weapon of scorn wherewith to wound
      him. A crow, she dubbed him; a canting, psalm-chanting hypocrite; a
      Scripture-monger, and every other contumelious epithet of like import that
      she should call to mind. He heard her in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it for you, Cynthia,&rdquo; he cried out in his surprise, &ldquo;the child of a
      God-fearing house, to mock the outward symbols of my faith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A faith,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;that is all outward symbols and naught besides;
      all texts and mournings and nose-twangings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go your ways, sir,&rdquo; she answered, half in jest, half in earnest. &ldquo;What
      need hath a true faith of outward symbols? It is a matter that lies
      between your God and yourself, and it is your heart He will look at, not
      your coat. Why, then, without becoming more acceptable in His eyes, shall
      you but render yourself unsightly in the eyes of man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth's cheeks were flushed with anger. From the terrace where they
      walked he let his glance roam towards the avenue that split the park in
      twain. Up this at that moment, with the least suspicion of a swagger in
      his gait, Sir Crispin Galliard was approaching leisurely; he wore a
      claret-coloured doublet edged with silver lace, and a grey hat decked with
      a drooping red feather&mdash;which garments, together with the rest of his
      apparel, he had drawn from the wardrobe of Gregory Ashburn. His advent
      afforded Kenneth the retort he needed. Pointing him out to Cynthia:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you rather,&rdquo; he cried hotly, &ldquo;have me such a man as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, pray, why not?&rdquo; she taunted him. &ldquo;Leastways, you would then be a
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, madam, a debauchee, a drunkard, a profligate, a brawler be your
      conception of a man, I would in faith you did not account me one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what, sir, would you sooner elect to be accounted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman, madam,&rdquo; he answered pompously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said she quietly, &ldquo;that you are in as little danger of becoming
      the one as the other. A gentleman does not slander a man behind his back,
      particularly when he owes that man his life. Kenneth, I am ashamed of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not slander,&rdquo; he insisted hotly. &ldquo;You yourself know of the drunken
      excess wherewith three nights ago he celebrated his coming to Castle
      Marleigh. Nor do I forget what I owe him, and payment is to be made in a
      manner you little know of. If I said of him what I did, it was but in
      answer to your taunts. Think you I could endure comparison with such a man
      as that? Know you what name the Royalists give him? They call him the
      Tavern Knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked him over with an eye of quiet scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how, sir, do they call you? The pulpit knight? Or is it the knight of
      the white feather? Mr. Stewart, you weary me. I would have a man who with
      a man's failings hath also a man's redeeming virtues of honesty, chivalry,
      and courage, and a record of brave deeds, rather than one who has nothing
      of the man save the coat&mdash;that outward symbol you lay such store by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His handsome, weak face was red with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since that is so, madam,&rdquo; he choked, &ldquo;I leave you to your swaggering,
      ruffling Cavalier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, without so much as a bow, he swung round on his heel and left her. It
      was her turn to grow angry now, and well it was for him that he had not
      tarried. She dwelt with scorn upon his parting taunt, bethinking herself
      that in truth she had exaggerated her opinions of Galliard's merits. Her
      feelings towards that ungodly gentleman were rather of pity than aught
      else. A brave, ready-witted man she knew him for, as much from the story
      of his escape from Worcester as for the air that clung to him despite his
      swagger, and she deplored that one possessing these ennobling virtues
      should have fallen notwithstanding upon such evil ways as those which
      Crispin trod. Some day, perchance, when she should come to be better
      acquainted with him, she would seek to induce him to mend his course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such root did this thought take in her mind that soon thereafter&mdash;and
      without having waited for that riper acquaintance which at first she had
      held necessary&mdash;she sought to lead their talk into the channels of
      this delicate subject. But he as sedulously confined it to trivial matter
      whenever she approached him in this mood, fencing himself about with a
      wall of cold reserve that was not lightly to be overthrown. In this his
      conscience was at work. Cynthia was the flaw in the satisfaction he might
      have drawn from the contemplation of the vengeance he was there to wreak.
      He beheld her so pure, so sweet and fresh, that he marvelled how she came
      to be the daughter of Gregory Ashburn. His heart smote him at the thought
      of how she&mdash;the innocent&mdash;must suffer with the guilty, and at
      the contemplation of the sorrow which he must visit upon her. Out of this
      sprang a constraint when in her company, for other than stiff and formal
      he dared not be lest he should deem himself no better than the Iscariot.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first days he had spent at Marleigh, he had been impatient for
      Joseph Ashburn's return. Now he found himself hoping each morning that
      Joseph might not come that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A courier reached Gregory from Windsor with a letter wherein his brother
      told him that the Lord General, not being at the castle, he was gone on to
      London in quest of him. And Gregory, lacking the means to inform him that
      the missing Kenneth was already returned, was forced to possess his soul
      in patience until his brother, having learnt what was to be learnt of
      Cromwell, should journey home.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the days sped on, and a week wore itself out in peace at Castle
      Marleigh, none dreaming of the volcano on which they stood. Each night
      Crispin and Gregory sat together at the board after Kenneth and Cynthia
      had withdrawn, and both drank deep&mdash;the one for the vice of it, the
      other (as he had always done) to seek forgetfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He needed it now more than ever, for he feared that the consideration of
      Cynthia might yet unman him. Had she scorned and avoided him and having
      such evidences of his ways of life he marvelled that she did not&mdash;he
      might have allowed his considerations of her to weigh less heavily. As it
      was, she sought him out, nor seemed rebuffed at his efforts to evade her,
      and in every way she manifested a kindliness that drove him almost to the
      point of despair, and well-nigh to hating her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth, knowing naught of the womanly purpose that actuated her, and
      seeing but the outward signs, which, with ready jealousy, he misconstrued
      and magnified, grew sullen and churlish to her, to Galliard, and even to
      Gregory.
    </p>
    <p>
      For hours he would mope alone, nursing his jealous mood, as though in this
      clownish fashion matters were to be mended. Did Cynthia but speak to
      Crispin, he scowled; did Crispin answer her, he grit his teeth at the
      covert meaning wherewith his fancy invested Crispin's tones; whilst did
      they chance to laugh together&mdash;a contingency that fortunately for his
      sanity was rare&mdash;he writhed in fury. He was a man transformed, and at
      times there was murder in his heart. Had he been a swordsman of more than
      moderate skill and dared to pit himself against the Tavern Knight, blood
      would have been shed in Marleigh Park betwixt them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed at last as if with his insensate jealousy all the evil humours
      that had lain dormant in the boy were brought to the surface, to overwhelm
      his erstwhile virtues&mdash;if qualities that have bigotry for a parent
      may truly be accounted virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast off, not abruptly, but piecemeal, those outward symbols&mdash;his
      sombre clothes. First 'twas his hat he exchanged for a feather-trimmed
      beaver of more sightly hue; then those stiff white bands that reeked of
      sanctity and cant for a collar of fine point; next it was his coat that
      took on a worldly edge of silver lace. And so, little by little, step by
      step, was the metamorphosis effected, until by the end of the week he came
      forth a very butterfly of fashion&mdash;a gallant, dazzling Cavalier. Out
      of a stern, forbidding Covenanter he was transformed in a few days into a
      most outrageous fop. He walked in an atmosphere of musk that he himself
      exhaled; his fair hair&mdash;that a while ago had hung so straight and
      limp&mdash;was now twisted into monstrous curls, a bunch of which were
      gathered by his right ear in a ribbon of pale blue silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galliard noted the change in amazement, yet, knowing to what follies youth
      is driven when it woos, he accounted Cynthia responsible for it, and
      laughed in his sardonic way, whereat the boy would blush and scowl in one.
      Gregory, too, looked on and laughed, setting it down to the same cause.
      Even Cynthia smiled, whereat the Tavern Knight was driven to ponder.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a courtier's raiment Kenneth put on, too, a courtier's ways; he grew
      mincing and affected in his speech, and he&mdash;whose utterance a while
      ago had been marked by a scriptural flavour&mdash;now set it off with some
      of Galliard's less unseemly oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since it was a ruffling gallant Cynthia required, he swore that a ruffling
      gallant should she find him; nor had he wit enough to see that his
      ribbons, his fopperies, and his capers served but to make him ridiculous
      in her eyes. He did indeed perceive, however, that in spite of this
      wondrous transformation, he made no progress in her favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What signify these fripperies?&rdquo; she asked him, one day, &ldquo;any more than
      did your coat of decent black? Are these also outward symbols?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may take them for such, madam,&rdquo; he answered sulkily. &ldquo;You liked me
      not as I was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I like you less as you are,&rdquo; she broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia, you mock me,&rdquo; he cried angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Heaven forbid! I do but mark the change,&rdquo; she answered airily.
      &ldquo;These scented clothes are but a masquerade, even as your coat of black
      and your cant were a masquerade. Then you simulated godliness; now you
      simulate Heaven knows what. But now, as then, it is no more than a
      simulation, a pretence of something that you are not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left her in a pet, and went in search of Gregory, into whose ear he
      poured the story of his woes that had their source in Cynthia's
      unkindness. From this resulted a stormy interview 'twixt Cynthia and her
      father, in which Cynthia at last declared that she would not be wedded to
      a fop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory shrugged his shoulders and laughed cynically, replying that it was
      the way of young men to be fools, and that through folly lay the road to
      wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; she answered him with spirit, &ldquo;this folly transcends
      all bounds. Master Stewart may return to his Scottish heather; at Castle
      Marleigh he is wasting time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;why be angry? You would not have me marry against
      the inclinations of my heart? You would not have me wedded to a man whom I
      despise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what right do you despise him?&rdquo; he demanded, his brow dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the right of the freedom of my thoughts&mdash;the only freedom that a
      woman knows. For the rest it seems she is but a chattel; of no more
      consideration to a man than his ox or his ass with which the Scriptures
      rank her&mdash;a thing to be given or taken, bought or sold, as others
      shall decree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child, child, what know you of these things?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You are
      overwrought, sweetheart.&rdquo; And with the promise to wait until a calmer
      frame of mind in her should be more propitious to what he wished to say
      further on this score, he left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out of doors in quest of solitude among the naked trees of the
      park; instead she found Sir Crispin, seated deep in thought upon a fallen
      trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the trees she espied him as she approached, whilst the rustle of
      her gown announced to him her coming. He rose as she drew nigh, and,
      doffing his hat, made shift to pass on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Crispin,&rdquo; she called, detaining him. He turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your servant, Mistress Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid of me, Sir Crispin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauty, madam, is wont to inspire courage rather than fear,&rdquo; he answered,
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, sir, is an evasion, not an answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If read aright, Mistress Cynthia, it is also an answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you do not fear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a habit of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, have you avoided me these three days past?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Despite himself Crispin felt his breath quickening&mdash;quickening with a
      pleasure that he sought not to account for&mdash;at the thought that she
      should have marked his absence from her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because perhaps if I did not,&rdquo; he answered slowly, &ldquo;you might come to
      avoid me. I am a proud man, Mistress Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satan, sir, was proud, but his pride led him to perdition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So indeed may mine,&rdquo; he answered readily, &ldquo;since it leads me from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sir,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;you go from me willingly enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not willingly, Cynthia. Oh, not willingly,&rdquo; he began. Then of a sudden he
      checked his tongue, and asked himself what he was saying. With a
      half-laugh and a courtier manner, he continued, &ldquo;Of two evils, madam, we
      must choose the lesser one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; she echoed, disregarding all else that he had said. &ldquo;It is an
      ugly word, and but a moment back you called me Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twas a liberty that methought my grey hairs warranted, and for which you
      should have reproved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not grey hairs enough to warrant it, Sir Crispin,&rdquo; she answered
      archly. &ldquo;But what if even so I account it no liberty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavy lids were lifted from her eyes, and as their glance, frank and
      kindly, met his, he trembled. Then, with a polite smile, he bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for the honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she looked at him in a puzzled way, then moved past him, and
      as he stood, stiffly erect, watching her graceful figure, he thought that
      she was about to leave him, and was glad of it. But ere she had taken half
      a dozen steps:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Crispin,&rdquo; said she, looking back at him over her shoulder, &ldquo;I am
      walking to the cliffs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never was a man more plainly invited to become an escort; but he ignored
      it. A sad smile crept into his harsh face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell Kenneth if I see him,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that she frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do not want him,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Sooner would I go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, madam, I'll tell nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was ever man so dull? she asked herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a fine view from the cliffs,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always thought so,&rdquo; he agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She inclined to call him a fool; yet she restrained herself. She had an
      impulse to go her way without him; but, then, she desired his company, and
      Cynthia was unused to having her desires frustrated. So finding him
      impervious to suggestion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not come with me?&rdquo; she asked at last, point-blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, if you wish it,&rdquo; he answered without alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may remain, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her offended tone aroused him now to the understanding that he was
      impolite. Contrite he stood beside her in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your permission, mistress, I will go with you. I am a dull fellow,
      and to-day I know not what mood is on me. So sorry a one that I feared I
      should be poor company. Still, if you'll endure me, I'll do my best to
      prove entertaining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; she answered coldly. &ldquo;I seek not the company of dull
      fellows.&rdquo; And she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood where she had left him, and breathed a most ungallant prayer of
      thanks. Next he laughed softly to himself, a laugh that was woeful with
      bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fore George!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;it is all that was wanting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reseated himself upon the fallen tree, and there he set himself to
      reflect, and to realize that he, war-worn and callous, come to Castle
      Marleigh on such an errand as was his, should wax sick at the very thought
      of it for the sake of a chit of a maid, with a mind to make a mock and a
      toy of him. Into his mind there entered even the possibility of flight,
      forgetful of the wrongs he had suffered, abandoning the vengeance he had
      sworn. Then with an oath he stemmed his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God in heaven, am I a boy, beardless and green?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;Am I
      turned seventeen again, that to look into a pair of eyes should make me
      forget all things but their existence?&rdquo; Then in a burst of passion: &ldquo;Would
      to Heaven,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;they had left me stark on Worcester Field!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose abruptly, and set out to walk aimlessly along, until suddenly a
      turn in the path brought him face to face with Cynthia. She hailed him
      with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir laggard, I knew that willy-nilly you would follow me,&rdquo; she cried. And
      he, taken aback, could not but smile in answer, and profess that she had
      conjectured rightly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. THE HEART OF CYNTHIA ASHBURN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Side by side stepped that oddly assorted pair along&mdash;the maiden whose
      soul was as pure and fresh as the breeze that blew upon them from the sea,
      and the man whose life years ago had been marred by a sorrow, the quest of
      whose forgetfulness had led him through the mire of untold sin; the girl
      upon the threshold of womanhood, her life all before her and seeming to
      her untainted mind a joyous, wholesome business; the man midway on his
      ill-starred career, his every hope blighted save the one odious hope of
      vengeance, which made him cling to a life he had proved worthless and
      ugly, and that otherwise he had likely enough cast from him. And as they
      walked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Crispin,&rdquo; she ventured timidly, &ldquo;you are unhappy, are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Startled by her words and the tone of them, Galliard turned his head that
      he might observe her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, unhappy?&rdquo; he laughed; and it was a laugh calculated to acknowledge the
      fitness of her question, rather than to refute it as he intended. &ldquo;Am I a
      clown, Cynthia, to own myself unhappy at such a season and while you
      honour me with your company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a wry face in protest that he fenced with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are happy, then?&rdquo; she challenged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is happiness?&rdquo; quoth he, much as Pilate may have questioned what was
      truth. Then before she could reply he hastened to add: &ldquo;I have not been
      quite so happy these many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not of the present moment that I speak,&rdquo; she answered reprovingly,
      for she scented no more than a compliment in his words, &ldquo;but of your
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now either was he imbued with a sense of modesty touching the deeds of
      that life of his, or else did he wisely realize that no theme could there
      be less suited to discourse upon with an innocent maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress Cynthia,&rdquo; said he as though he had not heard her question, &ldquo;I
      would say a word to you concerning Kenneth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that she turned upon him with a pout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is concerning yourself that I would have you talk. It is not nice
      to disobey a lady. Besides, I have little interest in Master Stewart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To have little interest in a future husband augurs ill for the time when
      he shall come to be your husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that you, at least, understood me. Kenneth will never be
      husband of mine, Sir Crispin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, lackaday! Am I to wed a doll?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Is he&mdash;is he a man
      a maid may love, Sir Crispin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, had you but seen the half of life that I have seen,&rdquo; said he
      unthinkingly, &ldquo;it might amaze you what manner of man a maid may love&mdash;or
      at least may marry. Come, Cynthia, what fault do you find with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, every fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed in unbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whom are we to blame for all these faults that have turned you so
      against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yourself, Cynthia. You use him ill, child. If his behaviour has been
      extravagant, you are to blame. You are severe with him, and he, in his
      rash endeavours to present himself in a guise that shall render him
      commendable in your eyes, has overstepped discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has my father bidden you to tell me this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when have I enjoyed your father's confidence to that degree? No,
      no, Cynthia. I plead the boy's cause to you because&mdash;I know not
      because of what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is ill to plead without knowing why. Let us forget the valiant
      Kenneth. They tell me, Sir Crispin&rdquo;&mdash;and she turned her glorious eyes
      upon him in a manner that must have witched a statue into answering her&mdash;&ldquo;that
      in the Royal army you were known as the Tavern Knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell you truly. What of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it? Do you blush at the very thought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I blush?&rdquo; He blinked, and his eyes were full of humour as they met her
      grave&mdash;almost sorrowing glance. Then a full-hearted peal of laughter
      broke from him, and scared a flight of gulls from the rocks of Sheringham
      Hithe below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cynthia! You'll kill me!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Picture to yourself this
      Crispin Galliard blushing and giggling like a schoolgirl beset by her
      first lover. Picture it, I say! As well and as easily might you picture
      old Lucifer warbling a litany for the edification of a Nonconformist
      parson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were severe in their reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is always so with you. You laugh and jest and make a mock of
      everything. Such I doubt not has been your way from the commencement, and
      'tis thus that you are come to this condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he laughed, but this time it was in bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sweet mistress, you are wrong&mdash;you are very wrong; it was not
      always thus. Time was&mdash;&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;Bah! 'Tis the coward cries &ldquo;time
      was&rdquo;! Leave me the past, Cynthia. It is dead, and of the dead we should
      speak no ill,&rdquo; he jested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there in your past?&rdquo; she insisted, despite his words. &ldquo;What is
      there in it so to have warped a character that I am assured was once&mdash;is,
      indeed, still&mdash;of lofty and noble purpose? What is it has brought you
      to the level you occupy&mdash;you who were born to lead; you who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have done, child. Have done,&rdquo; he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, tell me. Let us sit here.&rdquo; And taking hold of his sleeve, she sat
      herself upon a mound, and made room for him beside her on the grass. With
      a half-laugh and a sigh he obeyed her, and there, on the cliff, in the
      glow of the September sun, he took his seat at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence prevailed about them, emphasized rather than broken by the
      droning chant of a fisherman mending his nets on the beach below, the
      intermittent plash of the waves on the shingle, and the scream of the
      gulls that circled overhead. Before the eyes of his flesh was stretched a
      wide desert of sky and water, and before the eyes of his mind the hopeless
      desert of his thirty-eight years.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was almost tempted to speak. The note of sympathy in her voice allured
      him, and sympathy was to him as drink to one who perishes of thirst. A
      passionate, indefinable longing impelled him to pour out the story that in
      Worcester he had related unto Kenneth, and thus to set himself better in
      her eyes; to have her realize indeed that if he was come so low it was
      more the fault of others than his own. The temptation drew him at a
      headlong pace, to be checked at last by the memory that those others who
      had brought him to so sorry a condition were her own people. The humour
      passed. He laughed softly, and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing that I can tell you, child. Let us rather talk of
      Kenneth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish to talk of Kenneth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but you must. Willy-nilly must you. Think you it is only a war-worn,
      hard-drinking, swashbuckling ruffler that can sin? Does it not also occur
      to you that even a frail and tender little maid may do wrong as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wrong have I done?&rdquo; she cried in consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A grievous wrong to this poor lad. Can you not realize how the only
      desire that governs him is the laudable one of appearing favourably in
      your eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That desire gives rise, then, to curious manifestations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is mistaken in the means he adopts, that is all. In his heart his one
      aim is to win your esteem, and, after all, it is the sentiment that
      matters, not its manifestation. Why, then, are you unkind to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am not unkind. Or is it unkindness to let him see that I mislike
      his capers? Would it not be vastly more unkind to ignore them and
      encourage him to pursue their indulgence? I have no patience with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for those capers, I am endeavouring to show you that you yourself have
      driven him to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Crispin,&rdquo; she cried out, &ldquo;you grow tiresome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I grow tiresome. I grow tiresome because I preach of
      duty. Marry, it is in truth a tiresome topic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How duty? Of what do you talk?&rdquo; And a flush of incipient anger spread now
      on her fair cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be clearer,&rdquo; said he imperturbably. &ldquo;This lad is your betrothed.
      He is at heart a good lad, an honourable and honest lad&mdash;at times
      haply over-honest and over-honourable; but let that be. To please a whim,
      a caprice, you set yourself to flout him, as is the way of your sex when
      you behold a man your utter slave. From this&mdash;being all unversed in
      the obliquity of woman&mdash;he conceives, poor boy, that he no longer
      finds favour in your eyes, and to win back this, the only thing that in
      the world he values, he behaves foolishly. You flout him anew, and because
      of it. He is as jealous with you as a hen with her brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jealous?&rdquo; echoed Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, jealous; and so far does he go as to be jealous even of me,&rdquo; he
      cried, with infinitely derisive relish. &ldquo;Think of it&mdash;he is jealous
      of me! Jealous of him they call the Tavern Knight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did think of it as he bade her. And by thinking she stumbled upon a
      discovery that left her breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange how we may bear a sentiment in our hearts without so much as
      suspecting its existence, until suddenly a chance word shall so urge it
      into life that it reveals itself with unmistakable distinctness. With her
      the revelation began in a vague wonder at the scorn with which Crispin
      invested the notion that Kenneth should have cause for jealousy on his
      score. Was it, she asked herself, so monstrously unnatural? Then in a
      flash the answer came&mdash;and it was, that far from being a matter for
      derision, such an attitude in Kenneth lacked not for foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that moment she knew that it was because of Crispin; because of this
      man who spoke with such very scorn of self, that Kenneth had become in her
      eyes so mean and unworthy a creature. Loved him she haply never had, but
      leastways she had tolerated&mdash;been even flattered by&mdash;his wooing.
      By contrasting him now with Crispin she had grown to despise him. His
      weakness, his pusillanimity, his meannesses of soul, stood out in sharp
      relief by contrast with the masterful strength and the high spirit of Sir
      Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      So easily may our ideals change that the very graces of face and form that
      a while ago had pleased her in Kenneth, seemed now effeminate attributes,
      well-attuned to a vacillating, purposeless mind. Far greater beauty did
      her eyes behold in this grimfaced soldier of fortune; the man as firm of
      purpose as he was upright of carriage; gloomy, proud, and reckless; still
      young, yet past the callow age of adolescence. Since the day of his coming
      to Castle Marleigh she had brought herself to look upon him as a hero
      stepped from the romancers' tales that in secret she had read. The mystery
      that seemed to envelop him; those hints at a past that was not good&mdash;but
      the measure of whose evil in her pure innocence she could not guess; his
      very melancholy, his misfortunes, and the deeds she had heard assigned to
      him, all had served to fire her fancy and more besides, although, until
      that moment, she knew it not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subconsciously all this had long dwelt in her mind. And now of a sudden
      that self-deriding speech of Crispin's had made her aware of its presence
      and its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved him. That men said his life had not been nice, that he was a
      soldier of fortune, little better than an adventurer, a man of no worldly
      weight, were matters of no moment then to her. She loved him. She knew it
      now because he had mockingly bidden her to think whether Kenneth had cause
      to be jealous of him, and because upon thinking of it, she found that did
      Kenneth know what was in her heart, he must have more than cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved him with that rare love that will urge a woman to the last
      sacrifice a man may ask; a love that gives and gives, and seeks nothing in
      return; that impels a woman to follow the man at his bidding, be his way
      through the world cast in places never so rugged; cleaving to him where
      all besides shall have abandoned him; and, however dire his lot, asking of
      God no greater blessing than that of sharing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to such a love as this Crispin was blind&mdash;blind to the very
      possibility of its existence; so blind that he laughed to scorn the idea
      of a puny milksop being jealous of him. And so, while she sat, her soul
      all mastered by her discovery, her face white and still for very awe of
      it, he to whom this wealth was given, pursued the odious task of wooing
      her for another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have observed&mdash;you must have observed this insensate jealousy,&rdquo;
       he was saying, &ldquo;and how do you allay it? You do not. On the contrary, you
      excite it at every turn. You are exciting it now by having&mdash;and I
      dare swear for no other purpose&mdash;lured me to walk with you, to sit
      here with you and preach your duty to you. And when, through jealousy, he
      shall have flown to fresh absurdities, shall you regret your conduct and
      the fruits it has borne? Shall you pity the lad, and by kindness induce
      him to be wiser? No. You will mock and taunt him into yet worse displays.
      And through these displays, which are&mdash;though you may not have
      bethought you of it&mdash;of your own contriving, you will conclude that
      he is no fit mate for you, and there will be heart-burnings, and years
      hence perhaps another Tavern Knight, whose name will not be Crispin
      Galliard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had listened with bent head; indeed, so deeply rapt by her discovery,
      that she had but heard the half of what he said. Now, of a sudden, she
      looked up, and meeting his glance:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is it a woman's fault that you are as you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not. But how does that concern the case of Kenneth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not. I was but curious. I was not thinking of Kenneth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her, dumfounded. Had he been talking of Kenneth to her with
      such eloquence and such fervour, that she should calmly tell him as he
      paused that it was not of Kenneth she had been thinking?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will think of him, Cynthia?&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;You will bethink you too of
      what I have said, and by being kinder and more indulgent with this youth
      you shall make him grow into a man you may take pride in. Deal fairly with
      him, child, and if anon you find you cannot truly love him, then tell him
      so. But tell him kindly and frankly, instead of using him as you are
      doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent a moment, and in their poignancy her feelings went very
      near to anger. Presently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would, Sir Crispin, you could hear him talk of you,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He talks ill, not a doubt of it, and like enough he has good cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you saved his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words awoke Crispin, the philosopher of love, to realities. He
      recalled the circumstances of his saving Kenneth, and the price the boy
      was to pay for that service; and it suddenly came to him that it was
      wasted breath to plead Kenneth's cause with Cynthia, when by his own
      future actions he was, himself, more than likely to destroy the boy's
      every hope of wedding her. The irony of his attitude smote him hard, and
      he rose abruptly. The sun hung now a round, red globe upon the very brink
      of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hereafter he may have little cause to thank me,&rdquo; muttered he. &ldquo;Come,
      Mistress Cynthia, it grows late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose in mechanical obedience, and together they retraced their steps
      in silence, save for the stray word exchanged at intervals touching
      matters of no moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had not advocated Kenneth's cause in vain, for all that he little
      recked what his real argument had been, what influences he had evoked to
      urge her to make her peace with the lad. A melancholy listlessness of mind
      possessed her now. Crispin did not see, never would see, what was in her
      heart, and it might not be hers to show him. The life that might have
      signified was not to be lived, and since that was so it seemed to matter
      little what befell.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thus that when on the morrow her father returned to the subject,
      she showed herself tractable and docile out of her indifference, and to
      Gregory she appeared not averse to listen to what he had to advance in the
      boy's favour. Anon Kenneth's own humble pleading, allied to his contrite
      and sorrowful appearance, were received by her with that same
      indifference, as also with indifference did she allow him later to kiss
      her hand and assume the flattering belief that he was rehabilitated in her
      favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But pale grew Mistress Cynthia's cheeks, and sad her soul. Wistful she
      waxed, sighing at every turn, until it seemed to her&mdash;as haply it
      hath seemed to many a maid&mdash;that all her life must she waste in vain
      sighs over a man who gave no single thought to her.

      CHAPTER XV. JOSEPH'S RETURN
    </h2>
    <p>
      On his side Kenneth strove hard during the days that followed to right
      himself in her eyes. But so headlong was he in the attempt, and so
      misguided, that presently he overshot his mark by dropping an unflattering
      word concerning Crispin, whereby he attributed to the Tavern Knight's
      influence and example the degenerate change that had of late been wrought
      in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's eyes grew hard as he spoke, and had he been wise he had better
      served his cause by talking in another vein. But love and jealousy had so
      addled what poor brains the Lord had bestowed upon him, that he floundered
      on, unmindful of any warning that took not the blunt shape of words. At
      length, however, she stemmed the flow of invective that his lips poured
      forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not told you already, Kenneth, that it better becomes a gentleman
      not to slander the man to whom he owes his life? In fact, that a gentleman
      would scorn such an action?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he had protested before, so did he protest now, that what he had
      uttered was no slander. And in his rage and mortification at the way she
      used him, and for which he now bitterly upbraided her, he was very near
      the point of tears, like the blubbering schoolboy that at heart he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as for the debt, madam,&rdquo; he cried, striking the oaken table of the
      hall with his clenched hand, &ldquo;it is a debt that shall be paid, a debt
      which this gentleman whom you defend would not permit me to contract until
      I had promised payment&mdash;aye, 'fore George!&mdash;and with interest,
      for in the payment I may risk my very life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no interest in that, since you risk nothing more than what you owe
      him,&rdquo; she answered, with a disdain that brought the impending tears to his
      eyes. But if he lacked the manliness to restrain them, he possessed at
      least the shame to turn his back and hide them from her. &ldquo;But tell me,
      sir,&rdquo; she added, her curiosity awakened, &ldquo;if I am to judge, what was the
      nature of this bargain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment, and took a turn in the hall&mdash;mastering
      himself to speak&mdash;his hands clasped behind his back, and his eyes
      bent towards the polished floor which the evening sunlight, filtered
      through the gules of the leaded windows, splashed here and there with a
      crimson stain. She sat in the great leathern chair at the head of the
      board, and, watching him, waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was debating whether he was bound to secrecy in the matter, and in the
      end he resolved that he was not. Thereupon, pausing before her, he
      succinctly told the story Crispin had related to him that night in
      Worcester&mdash;the story of a great wrong, that none but a craven could
      have left unavenged. He added nothing to it, subtracted nothing from it,
      but told the tale as it had been told to him on that dreadful night, the
      memory of which had still power to draw a shudder from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia sat with parted lips and eager eyes, drinking in that touching
      narrative of suffering that was rather as some romancer's fabrication than
      a true account of what a living man had undergone. Now with sorrow and
      pity in her heart and countenance, now with anger and loathing, she
      listened until he had done, and even when he ceased speaking, and flung
      himself into the nearest chair, she sat on in silence for a spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then of a sudden she turned a pair of flashing eyes upon the boy, and in
      tones charged with a scorn ineffable:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dare,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;to speak of that man as you do, knowing all this?
      Knowing what he has suffered, you dare to rail in his absence against
      those sins to which his misfortunes have driven him? How, think you, would
      it have fared with you, you fool, had you stood in the shoes of this
      unfortunate? Had you fallen on your craven knees, and thanked the Lord for
      allowing you to keep your miserable life? Had you succumbed to the blows
      of fate with a whine of texts upon your lips? Who are you?&rdquo; she went on,
      rising, breathless in her wrath, which caused him to recoil in sheer
      affright before her. &ldquo;Who are you, and what are you, that knowing what you
      know of this man's life, you dare to sit in judgment upon his actions and
      condemn them? Answer me, you fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But never a word had he wherewith to meet that hail of angry, contemptuous
      questions. The answer that had been so ready to his lips that night at
      Worcester, when, in a milder form the Tavern Knight had set him the same
      question, he dared not proffer now. The retort that Sir Crispin had not
      cause enough in the evil of others, which had wrecked his life, to risk
      the eternal damnation of his soul, he dared no longer utter. Glibly enough
      had he said to that stern man that which he dared not say now to this
      sterner beauty. Perhaps it was fear of her that made him dumb, perhaps
      that at last he knew himself for what he was by contrast with the man
      whose vices he had so heartily despised a while ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shrinking back before her anger, he racked his shallow mind in vain for a
      fitting answer. But ere he had found one, a heavy step sounded in the
      gallery that overlooked the hall, and a moment later Gregory Ashburn
      descended. His face was ghastly white, and a heavy frown furrowed the
      space betwixt his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fleeting glance she bestowed upon her father, she remarked not the
      disorder of his countenance; whilst as for Kenneth, he had enough to hold
      his attention for the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory's advent set an awkward constraint upon them, nor had he any word
      to say as he came heavily up the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the lower end of the long table he paused, and resting his hand upon
      the board, he seemed on the point of speaking when of a sudden a sound
      reached him that caused him to draw a sharp breath; it was the rumble of
      wheels and the crack of a whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Joseph!&rdquo; he cried, in a voice the relief of which was so marked
      that Cynthia noticed it. And with that exclamation he flung past them, and
      out through the doorway to meet his brother so opportunely returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the terrace steps as the coach pulled up, and the lean figure
      of Joseph Ashburn emerged from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Gregory,&rdquo; he grumbled for greeting, &ldquo;it was on a fool's errand you
      sent me, after all. That knave, your messenger, found me in London at last
      when I had outworn my welcome at Whitehall. But, 'swounds, man,&rdquo; he cried,
      remarking the pallor, of his brother's face, &ldquo;what ails thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have news for you, Joseph,&rdquo; answered Gregory, in a voice that shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not Cynthia?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Nay, for there she stands-and her
      pretty lover by her side. 'Slife, what a coxcomb the lad's grown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that he hastened forward to kiss his niece, and congratulate
      Kenneth upon being restored to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard of it, lad, in London,&rdquo; quoth he, a leer upon his sallow face&mdash;&ldquo;the
      story of how a fire-eater named Galliard befriended you, trussed a parson
      and a trooper, and dragged you out of jail a short hour before
      hanging-time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth flushed. He felt the sneer in Joseph's, words like a stab. The
      man's tone implied that another had done for him that which he would not
      have dared do for himself, and Kenneth felt that this was so said in
      Cynthia's presence with malicious, purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was right. Partly it was Joseph's way to be spiteful and venomous
      whenever chance afforded him the opportunity. Partly he had been
      particularly soured at present by his recent discomforts, suffered in a
      cause wherewith he had no, sympathy&mdash;that of the union Gregory
      desired 'twixt Cynthia and Kenneth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an evil smile on his thin lips, and his crooked eyes rested
      tormentingly upon the young man. A fresh taunt trembled on his viperish
      tongue, when Gregory plucked at the skirts of his coat, and drew him
      aside. They entered the chamber where they had held their last interview
      before Joseph had set out for news of Kenneth. With an air of mystery
      Gregory closed the door, then turned to face his brother. He stayed him in
      the act of unbuckling his sword-belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Joseph!&rdquo; he cried dramatically. &ldquo;This is no time to disarm. Keep
      your sword on your thigh, man; you will need it as you never yet have
      needed it.&rdquo; He paused, took a deep breath, and hurled the news at his
      brother. &ldquo;Roland Marleigh is here.&rdquo; And he sat down like a man exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph did not start; he did not cry out; he did not so much as change
      countenance. A slight quiver of the eyelids was the only outward sign he
      gave of the shock that his brother's announcement had occasioned. The hand
      that had rested on the buckle of his sword-belt slipped quietly to his
      side, and he deliberately stepped up to Gregory, his eyes set searchingly
      upon the pale, flabby face before him. A sudden suspicion darting through
      his mind, he took his brother by the shoulders and shook him vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gregory, you fool, you have drunk overdeep in my absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, I have,&rdquo; wailed Gregory, &ldquo;and, my God, 'twas he was my
      table-fellow, and set me the example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like enough, like enough,&rdquo; returned Joseph, with a contemptuous laugh.
      &ldquo;My poor Gregory, the wine has so fouled your worthless wits at last, that
      they conjure up phantoms to sit at the table with you. Come, man, what
      petticoat business is this? Bestir yourself, fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that Gregory caught the drift of Joseph's suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis you are the fool,&rdquo; he retorted angrily, springing to his feet, and
      towering above his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no ghost sat with me, but Roland Marleigh, himself, in the flesh,
      and strangely changed by time. So changed that I knew him not, nor should
      I know him now but for that which, not ten minutes ago, I overheard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His earnestness was too impressive, his sanity too obvious, and Joseph's
      suspicions were all scattered before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught Gregory's wrist in a grip that made him wince, and forced him
      back into his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gadslife, man, what is it you mean?&rdquo; he demanded through set teeth. &ldquo;Tell
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And forthwith Gregory told him of the manner of Kenneth's coming to
      Sheringham and to Castle Marleigh, accompanied by one Crispin Galliard,
      the same that had been known for his mad exploits in the late wars as
      &ldquo;rakehelly Galliard,&rdquo; and that was now known to the malignants as &ldquo;The
      Tavern Knight&rdquo; for his debauched habits. Crispin's mention of Roland
      Marleigh on the night of his arrival now returned vividly to Gregory's
      mind, and he repeated it, ending with the story that that very evening he
      had overheard Kenneth telling Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this Galliard, then, is none other than that pup of insolence, Roland
      Marleigh, grown into a dog of war?&rdquo; quoth Joseph.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was calm&mdash;singularly calm for one who had heard such news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There remains no doubt of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you saw this man day by day, sat with him night by night over your
      damned sack, and knew him not? Oddswounds, man, where were your eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have been blind. But he is greatly changed. I would defy you,
      Joseph, to have recognized him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph sneered, and the flash of his eyes told of the contempt wherein he
      held his brother's judgment and opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not that, Gregory. I have cause enough to remember him,&rdquo; said
      Joseph, with an unpleasant laugh. Then as suddenly changing his tone for
      one of eager anxiety:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the lad, Gregory, does he suspect, think you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a whit. In that lies this fellow's diabolical cunning. Learning of
      Kenneth's relations with us, he seized the opportunity Fate offered him
      that night at Worcester, and bound the lad on oath to help him when he
      should demand it, without disclosing the names of those against whom he
      should require his services. The boy expects at any moment to be bidden to
      go forth with him upon his mission of revenge, little dreaming that it is
      here that that tragedy is to be played out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This comes of your fine matrimonial projects for Cynthia,&rdquo; muttered
      Joseph acridly. He laughed his unpleasant laugh again, and for a spell
      there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think, Gregory,&rdquo; he broke out at last, &ldquo;that for a fortnight he should
      have been beneath this roof, and you should have found no means of doing
      more effectively that which was done too carelessly eighteen years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke as coldly as though the matter were a trivial one. Gregory
      shuddered and looked at his brother in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now, fool?&rdquo; cried Joseph, scowling. &ldquo;Are you as cowardly as you are
      blind? Damn me, sir, it seems well that I am returned. I'll have no
      Marleigh plague my old age for me.&rdquo; He paused a moment, then continued in
      a quieter voice, but one whose ring was sinister beyond words: &ldquo;Tomorrow I
      shall find a way to draw this your dog of war to some secluded ground. I
      have some skill,&rdquo; he pursued, tapping his hilt as he spoke, &ldquo;besides, you
      shall be there, Gregory.&rdquo; And he smiled darkly. &ldquo;Is there no other way?&rdquo;
       asked Gregory, in distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was,&rdquo; answered Joseph. &ldquo;There was in Parliament. At Whitehall I met
      a man&mdash;one Colonel Pride&mdash;a bloodthirsty old Puritan soldier,
      who would give his right hand to see this Galliard hanged. Galliard, it
      seems, slew the fellow's son at Worcester. Had I but known,&rdquo; he added
      regretfully&mdash;&ldquo;had your wits been keener, and you had discovered it
      and sent me word, I had found means to help Colonel Pride to his revenge.
      As it is&rdquo;&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;there is not time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be&mdash;&rdquo; began Gregory, then stopped abruptly with an
      exclamation that caused Joseph to wheel sharply round. The door had
      opened, and on the threshold Sir Crispin Galliard stood, deferentially,
      hat in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph's astonished glance played rapidly over him for a second. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the devil may you be?&rdquo; he blurted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite his anxiety, Gregory chuckled at the question. The Tavern Knight
      came forward. &ldquo;I am Sir Crispin Galliard, at your service,&rdquo; said he,
      bowing. &ldquo;I was told that the master of Marleigh was returned, and that I
      should find you here, and I hasten, sir, to proffer you my thanks for the
      generous shelter this house has given me this fortnight past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he spoke he measured Joseph with his eyes, and his glance was as
      hateful as his words were civil. Joseph was lost in amazement. Little
      trace was there in this fellow of the Roland Marleigh he had known.
      Moreover, he had looked to find an older man, forgetting that Roland's age
      could not exceed thirty-eight. Then, again, the fading light, whilst
      revealing the straight, supple lines of his lank figure, softened the
      haggardness of the face and made him appear yet younger than the light of
      day would have shown him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant Joseph had recovered from his surprise, and for all that his
      mind misgave him tortured by a desire to learn whether Crispin was aware
      of their knowledge concerning him&mdash;his smile was serene, and his
      tones level and pleasant, as he made answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you are very welcome. You have valiantly served one dear to us, and
      the entertainment of our poor house for as long as you may deign to honour
      it is but the paltriest of returns.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. THE RECKONING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir Crispin had heard naught of what was being said as he entered the room
      wherein the brothers plotted against him, and he little dreamt that his
      identity was discovered. He had but hastened to perform that which, under
      ordinary circumstances, would have been a natural enough duty towards the
      master of the house. He had been actuated also by an impatience again to
      behold this Joseph Ashburn&mdash;the man who had dealt him that murderous
      sword-thrust eighteen years ago. He watched him attentively, and gathering
      from his scrutiny that here was a dangerous, subtle man, different,
      indeed, to his dull-witted brother, he had determined to act at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so when he appeared in the hall at suppertime, he came armed and
      booted, and equipped as for a journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph was standing alone by the huge fire-place, his face to the burning
      logs, and his foot resting upon one of the andirons. Gregory and his
      daughter were talking together in the embrasure of a window. By the other
      window, across the hall, stood Kenneth, alone and disconsolate, gazing out
      at the drizzling rain that had begun to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Galliard descended, Joseph turned his head, and his eyebrows shot up
      and wrinkled his forehead at beholding the knight's equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this, Sir Crispin?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You are going a journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too long already have I imposed myself upon the hospitality of Castle
      Marleigh,&rdquo; Crispin answered politely as he came and stood before the
      blazing logs. &ldquo;To-night, Mr. Ashburn, I go hence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A curious expression flitted across Joseph's face. The next moment, his
      brows still knit as he sought to fathom his sudden action, he was
      muttering the formal regrets that courtesy dictated. But Crispin had
      remarked that singular expression on Joseph's face&mdash;fleeting though
      it had been&mdash;and it flashed across his mind that Joseph knew him. And
      as he moved away towards Cynthia and her father, he thanked Heaven that he
      had taken such measures as he had thought wise and prudent for the
      carrying out of his resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following him with a glance, Joseph asked himself whether Crispin had
      discovered that he was recognized, and had determined to withdraw, leaving
      his vengeance for another and more propitious season. In answer&mdash;little
      knowing the measure of the man he dealt with&mdash;he told himself it must
      be so, and having arrived at that conclusion, he there and then determined
      that Crispin should not depart free to return and plague them when he
      listed. Since Galliard shrank from forcing matters to an issue, he himself
      would do it that very night, and thereby settle for all time his business.
      And so ere he sat down to sup Joseph looked to it that his sword lay at
      hand behind his chair at the table-head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal was a quiet one enough. Kenneth was sulking 'neath the fresh
      ill-usage&mdash;as he deemed it&mdash;that he had suffered at Cynthia's
      hands. Cynthia, in her turn, was grave and silent. That story of Sir
      Crispin's sufferings gave her much to think of, as did also his departure,
      and more than once did Galliard find her eyes fixed upon him with a look
      half of pity, half of some other feeling that he was at a loss to
      interpret. Gregory's big voice was little heard. The sinister glitter in
      his brother's eye made him apprehensive and ill at ease. For him the hour
      was indeed in travail and like to bring forth strange doings&mdash;but not
      half so much as it was for Crispin and Joseph, each bent upon forcing
      matters to a head ere they quitted that board. And yet but for these two
      the meal would have passed off in dismal silence. Joseph was at pains to
      keep suspicion from his guest, and with that intent he talked gaily of
      this and that, told of slight matters that had befallen him on his recent
      journey and of the doings that in London he had witnessed, investing each
      trifling incident with a garb of wit that rendered it entertaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Galliard&mdash;actuated by the same motives grew reminiscent whenever
      Joseph paused and let his nimble tongue&mdash;even nimblest at a table
      amuse those present, or seem to amuse them, by a score of drolleries.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drank deeply too, and this Joseph observed with satisfaction. But here
      again he misjudged his man. Kenneth, who ate but little, seemed also to
      have developed an enormous thirst, and Crispin grew at length alarmed at
      that ever empty goblet so often filled. He would have need of Kenneth ere
      the hour was out, and he rightly feared that did matters thus continue,
      the lad's aid was not to be reckoned with. Had Kenneth sat beside him he
      might have whispered a word of restraint in his eat, but the lad was on
      the other side of the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one moment Crispin fancied that a look of intelligence passed from
      Joseph to Gregory, and when presently Gregory set himself to ply both him
      and the boy with wine, his suspicions became certainties, and he grew
      watchful and wary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anon Cynthia rose. Upon the instant Galliard was also on his feet. He
      escorted her to the foot of the staircase, and there:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me, Mistress Cynthia,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to take my leave of you. In an
      hour or so I shall be riding away from Castle Marleigh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes sought the ground, and had he been observant of her he might have
      noticed that she paled slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fare you well, sir,&rdquo; said she in a low voice. &ldquo;May happiness attend you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, I thank you. Fare you well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed low. She dropped him a slight curtsey, and ascended the stairs.
      Once as she reached the gallery above she turned. He had resumed his seat
      at table, and was in the act of filling his glass. The servants had
      withdrawn, and for half an hour thereafter they sat on, sipping their
      wine, and making conversation&mdash;while Crispin drained bumper after
      bumper and grew every instant more boisterous, until at length his
      boisterousness passed into incoherence. His eyelids drooped heavily, and
      his chin kept ever and anon sinking forward on to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth, flushed with wine, yet master of his wits, watched him with
      contempt. This was the man Cynthia preferred to him! Contempt was there
      also in Joseph Ashburn's eye, mingled with satisfaction. He had not looked
      to find the task so easy. At length he deemed the season ripe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother tells me that you were once acquainted with Roland Marleigh,&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he answered thickly. &ldquo;I knew the dog&mdash;a merry, reckless soul,
      d&mdash;n me. 'Twas his recklessness killed him, poor devil&mdash;that and
      your hand, Mr. Ashburn, so the story goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What story?&rdquo; echoed Crispin. &ldquo;The story that I heard. Do you say I lie?&rdquo;
       And, swaying in his chair, he sought to assume an air of defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph laughed in a fashion that made Kenneth's blood run cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, I don't deny it. It was in fair fight he fell. Moreover, he
      brought the duel upon himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin spoke no word in answer, but rose unsteadily to his feet, so
      unsteadily that his chair was overset and fell with a crash behind him.
      For a moment he surveyed it with a drunken leer, then went lurching across
      the hall towards the door that led to the servants' quarters. The three
      men sat on, watching his antics in contempt, curiosity, and amusement.
      They saw him gain the heavy oaken door and close it. They heard the bolts
      rasp as he shot them home, and the lock click; and they saw him withdraw
      the key and slip it into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold smile still played round Joseph's lips as Crispin turned to face
      them again, and on Joseph's lips did that same smile freeze as he saw him
      standing there, erect and firm, his drunkenness all vanished, and his eyes
      keen and fierce; as he heard the ring of his metallic voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie, Joseph Ashburn. It was no fair fight. It was no duel. It was a
      foul, murderous stroke you dealt him in the back, thinking to butcher him
      as you butchered his wife and his babe. But there is a God, Master
      Ashburn,&rdquo; he went on in an ever-swelling voice, &ldquo;and I lived. Like a
      salamander I came through the flames in which you sought to destroy all
      trace of your vile deed. I lived, and I, Crispin Galliard, the debauched
      Tavern Knight that was once Roland Marleigh, am here to demand a
      reckoning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The very incarnation was he then of an avenger, as he stood towering
      before them, his grim face livid with the passion into which he had lashed
      himself as he spoke, his blazing eyes watching them in that cunning,
      half-closed way that was his when his mood was dangerous. And yet the only
      one that quailed was Kenneth, his ally, upon whom comprehension burst with
      stunning swiftness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph recovered quickly from the surprise of Crispin's suddenly reassumed
      sobriety. He understood the trick that Galliard had played upon them so
      that he might cut off their retreat in the only direction in which they
      might have sought assistance, and he cursed himself for not having
      foreseen it. Still, anxiety he felt none; his sword was to his hand, and
      Gregory was armed; at the very worst they were two calm and able men
      opposed to a half-intoxicated boy, and a man whom fury, he thought, must
      strip of half his power. Probably, indeed, the lad would side with them,
      despite his plighted word. Again, he had but to raise his voice, and,
      though the door that Crispin had fastened was a stout one, he never
      doubted but that his call would penetrate it and bring his servants to his
      rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, a smile of cynical unconcern returned to his lips and his answer
      was delivered in a cold, incisive voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reckoning you have come to demand shall be paid you, sir. Rakehelly
      Galliard is the hero of many a reckless deed, but my judgment is much at
      fault if this prove not his crowning recklessness and his last one.
      Gadswounds, sir, are you mad to come hither single-handed to beard the
      lion in his den?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather the cur in his kennel,&rdquo; sneered Crispin back. &ldquo;Blood and wounds,
      Master Joseph, think you to affright me with words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Joseph smiled, deeming himself master of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were help needed, the raising of my voice would bring it me. But it is
      not. We are three to one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You reckon wrongly. Mr. Stewart belongs to me to-night&mdash;bound by an
      oath that 'twould damn his soul to break, to help me when and where I may
      call upon him; and I call upon him now. Kenneth, draw your sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth groaned as he stood by, clasping and unclasping his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God's curse on you,&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;You have tricked me, you have cheated
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear your oath in mind,&rdquo; was the cold answer. &ldquo;If you deem yourself
      wronged by me, hereafter you shall have what satisfaction you demand. But
      first fulfil me what you have sworn. Out with your blade, man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Kenneth hesitated, and but for Gregory's rash action at that
      critical juncture, it is possible that he would have elected to break his
      plighted word. But Gregory fearing that he might determine otherwise,
      resolved there and then to remove the chance of it. Whipping out his
      sword, he made a vicious pass at the lad's breast. Kenneth avoided it by
      leaping backwards, but in an instant Gregory had sprung after him, and
      seeing himself thus beset, Kenneth was forced to draw that he might
      protect himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood in the space between the table and that part of the hall that
      abutted on to the terrace; opposite to them, by the door which he had
      closed, stood Crispin. At the table-head Joseph still sat cool,
      self-contained, even amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized the rashness of Gregory's attack upon one that might yet have
      been won over to their side; but he never doubted that a few passes would
      dispose of the lad's opposition, and he sought not to interfere. Then he
      saw Crispin advancing towards him slowly, his rapier naked in his hand,
      and he was forced to look to himself. He caught at the sword that stood
      behind him, and leaping to his feet he sprang forward to meet his grim
      antagonist. Galliard's eyes flashed out a look of joy, he raised his
      rapier, and their blades met.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the clash of their meeting came an echoing clash from beyond the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold, sir!&rdquo; Kenneth had cried, as Gregory bore down upon him. But
      Gregory's answer had been a lunge which the boy had been forced to parry.
      Taking that crossing of blades for a sign of opposition, Gregory thrust
      again more viciously. Kenneth parried narrowly, his blade pointing
      straight at his aggressor. He saw the opening, and both instinct and the
      desire to repel Gregory's onslaught drew him into attempting a riposte,
      which drove Gregory back until his shoulders touched the panels of the
      wall. Simultaneously the boy's foot struck the back of the chair which in
      rising Crispin had overset, and he stumbled. How it happened he scarcely
      knew, but as he hurtled forward his blade slid along his opponent's, and
      entering Gregory's right shoulder pinned him to the wainscot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph heard the tinkle of a falling blade, and assumed it to be
      Kenneth's. For the rest he was just then too busy to dare withdraw for a
      second his eyes from Crispin's. Until that hour Joseph Ashburn had
      accounted himself something of a swordsman, and more than a match for most
      masters of the weapon. But in Crispin he found a fencer of a quality such
      as he had never yet encountered. Every feint, every botte in his catalogue
      had he paraded in quick succession, yet ever with the same result&mdash;his
      point was foiled and put aside with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desperately he fought now, darting that point of his hither and thither in
      and out whenever the slightest opening offered; yet ever did it meet the
      gentle averting pressure of Crispin's blade. He fought on and marvelled as
      the seconds went by that Gregory came not to his aid. Then the sickening
      thought that perhaps Gregory was overcome occurred to him. In such a case
      he must reckon upon himself alone. He cursed the over-confidence that had
      led him into that ever-fatal error of underestimating his adversary. He
      might have known that one who had acquired Sir Crispin's fame was no
      ordinary man, but one accustomed to face great odds and master them. He
      might call for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      He marvelled as the thought occurred to him that the clatter of their
      blades had not drawn his servants from their quarters. Fencing still, he
      raised his voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, there! John, Stephen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare your breath,&rdquo; growled the knight. &ldquo;I dare swear you'll have need of
      it. None will hear you, call as you will. I gave your four henchmen a
      flagon of wine wherein to drink to my safe journey hence. They have
      emptied it ere this, I make no doubt, and a single glass of it would set
      the hardest toper asleep for the round of the clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An oath was Joseph's only answer&mdash;a curse it was upon his own folly
      and assurance. A little while ago he had thought to have drawn so tight a
      net about this ruler, and here was he now taken in its very toils,
      well-nigh exhausted and in his enemy's power.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to him then that Crispin stayed his hand. That he fenced only
      on the defensive, and he wondered what might his motive be. He realized
      that he was mastered, and that at any moment Galliard might send home his
      blade. He was bathed from head to foot in a sweat that was at once of
      exertion and despair. A frenzy seized him. Might he not yet turn to
      advantage this hesitancy of Crispin's to strike the final blow?
    </p>
    <p>
      He braced himself for a supreme effort, and turning his wrist from a
      simulated thrust in the first position, he doubled, and stretching out,
      lunged vigorously in quarte. As he lengthened his arm in the stroke there
      came a sudden twitch at his wrist; the weapon was twisted from his grasp,
      and he stood disarmed at Crispin's mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gurgling cry broke despite him from his lips, and his eyes grew wide in
      a sickly terror as they encountered the knight's sinister glance. Not
      three paces behind him was the wall, and on it, within the hand's easy
      reach, hung many a trophied weapon that might have served him then. But
      the fascination of fear was upon him, benumbing his wits and paralysing
      his limbs, with the thought that the next pulsation of his tumultuous
      heart would prove its last. The calm, unflinching courage that had been
      Joseph's only virtue was shattered, and his iron will that had
      unscrupulously held hitherto his very conscience in bondage was turned to
      water now that he stood face to face with death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eons of time it seemed to him were sped since the sword was wrenched from
      his hand, and still the stroke he awaited came not; still Crispin stood,
      sinister and silent before him, watching him with magnetic, fascinating
      eyes&mdash;as the snake watches the bird&mdash;eyes from which Joseph
      could not withdraw his own, and yet before which it seemed to him that he
      quaked and shrivelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The candles were burning low in their sconces, and the corners of that
      ample, gloomy hall were filled with mysterious shadows that formed a
      setting well attuned to the grim picture made by those two figures&mdash;the
      one towering stern and vengeful, the other crouching palsied and livid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the table, and with the wounded Gregory&mdash;lying unconscious and
      bleeding&mdash;at his feet, stood Kenneth looking on in silence, in wonder
      and in some horror too.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him also, as he watched, the seconds seemed minutes from the time when
      Crispin had disarmed his opponent until with a laugh&mdash;short and
      sudden as a stab&mdash;he dropped his sword and caught his victim by the
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      However fierce the passion that had actuated Crispin, it had been held
      hitherto in strong subjection. But now at last it suddenly welled up and
      mastered him, causing him to cast all restraint to the winds, to abandon
      reason, and to give way to the lust of rage that rendered ungovernable his
      mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a burst of flame from embers that have been smouldering was the
      upleaping of his madness, transfiguring his face and transforming his
      whole being. A new, unconquerable strength possessed him; his pulses
      throbbed swiftly and madly with the quickened coursing of his blood, and
      his soul was filled with the cruel elation that attends a lust about to be
      indulged the elation of the beast about to rend its prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was pervaded by the desire to wreak slowly and with his hands the
      destruction of his broken enemy. To have passed his sword through him
      would have been too swiftly done; the man would have died, and Crispin
      would have known nothing of his sufferings. But to take him thus by the
      throat; slowly to choke the life's breath out of him; to feel his
      desperate, writhing struggles; to be conscious of every agonized twitch of
      his sinews, to watch the purpling face, the swelling veins, the protruding
      eyes filled with the dumb horror of his agony; to hold him thus&mdash;each
      second becoming a distinct, appreciable division of time&mdash;and thus to
      take what payment he could for all the blighted years that lay behind him&mdash;this
      he felt would be something like revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the shock of surprise at the unlooked-for movement had awakened
      again the man in Joseph. For a second even Hope knocked at his heart. He
      was sinewy and active, and perchance he might yet make Galliard repent
      that he had discarded his rapier. The knight's reason for doing so he
      thought he had in Crispin's contemptuous words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good steel were too great an honour for you, Mr. Ashburn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he spoke, his lean, nervous fingers tightened about Joseph's throat
      in a grip that crushed the breath from him, and with it the new-born hope
      of proving master in his fresh combat. He had not reckoned with this
      galley-weaned strength of Crispin's, a strength that was a revelation to
      Joseph as he felt himself almost lifted from the ground, and swung this
      way and that, like a babe in the hands of a grown man. Vain were his
      struggles. His strength ebbed fast; the blood, held overlong in his head,
      was already obscuring his vision, when at last the grip relaxed, and his
      breathing was freed. As his sight cleared again he found himself back in
      his chair at the table-head, and beside him Sir Crispin, his left hand
      resting upon the board, his right grasping once more the sword, and his
      eyes bent mockingly and evilly upon his victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth, looking on, could not repress a shudder. He had known Crispin for
      a tempestuous man quickly moved to wrath, and he had oftentimes seen anger
      make terrible his face and glance. But never had he seen aught in him to
      rival this present frenzy; it rendered satanical the baleful glance of his
      eyes and the awful smile of hate and mockery with which he gazed at last
      upon the helpless quarry that he had waited eighteen years to bring to
      earth. &ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said Crispin, in a harsh, deliberate voice, &ldquo;that you
      had a score of lives, Master Joseph. As it is I have done what I could.
      Two agonies have you undergone already, and I am inclined to mercy. The
      end is at hand. If you have prayers to say, say them, Master Ashburn,
      though I doubt me it will be wasted breath&mdash;you are over-ripe for
      hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to kill me,&rdquo; he gasped, growing yet a shade more livid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the suspicion of it but occur to you?&rdquo; laughed Crispin, &ldquo;and yet
      twice already have I given you a foretaste of death. Think you I but
      jested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph's teeth clicked together in a snap of determination. That sneer of
      Crispin's acted upon him as a blow&mdash;but as a blow that arouses the
      desire to retaliate rather than lays low. He braced himself for fresh
      resistance; not of action, for that he realized was futile, but of
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is murder that you do,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is justice. It has been long on the way, but it has come at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bethink you, Mr. Marleigh&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me not by that name,&rdquo; cried the other harshly, fearfully. &ldquo;I have
      not borne it these eighteen years, and thanks to what you have made me, it
      is not meet that I should bear it now.&rdquo; There was a pause. Then Joseph
      spoke again with great calm and earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bethink you, Sir Crispin, of what you are about to do. It can benefit you
      in naught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oddslife, think you it cannot? Think you it will benefit me naught to see
      you earn at last your reward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may have dearly to pay for what at best must prove a fleeting
      satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a fleeting one, Joseph,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;But one the memory of which
      shall send me rejoicing through what years or days of life be left me. A
      satisfaction that for eighteen years I have been waiting to experience;
      though the moment after it be mine find me stark and cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Crispin, you are in enmity with the Parliament&mdash;an outlaw
      almost. I have some influence much influence. By exerting it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have done, sir!&rdquo; cried Crispin angrily. &ldquo;You talk in vain. What to me is
      life, or aught that life can give? If I have so long endured the burden of
      it, it has been so that I might draw from it this hour. Do you think there
      is any bribe you could offer would turn me from my purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A groan from Gregory, who was regaining consciousness, drew his attention
      aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truss him up, Kenneth,&rdquo; he commanded, pointing to the recumbent figure.
      &ldquo;How? Do you hesitate? Now, as God lives, I'll be obeyed; or you shall
      have an unpleasant reminder of the oath you swore me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a look of loathing the lad dropped on his knees to do as he was
      bidden. Then of a sudden:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the means,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool, does he not wear a sword-belt and a sash? Come, attend to it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you force me to do this?&rdquo; the lad still protested passionately.
      &ldquo;You have tricked and cheated me, yet I have kept my oath and rendered you
      the assistance you required. They are in your power now, can you not do
      the rest yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my soul, Master Stewart, I am over-patient with you! Are we to wrangle
      at every step before you'll take it? I will have your assistance through
      this matter as you swore to give it. Come, truss me that fellow, and have
      done with words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His fierceness overthrew the boy's outburst of resistance. Kenneth had wit
      enough to see that his mood was not one to brook much opposition, and so,
      with an oath and a groan, he went to work to pinion Gregory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Joseph spoke again. &ldquo;Weigh well this act of yours, Sir Crispin,&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;You are still young; much of life lies yet before you. Do not
      wantonly destroy it by an act that cannot repair the past.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;But it can avenge it, Joseph. As for my life, you destroyed it years ago.
      The future has naught to offer me; the present has this.&rdquo; And he drew back
      his sword to strike.

      CHAPTER XVII. JOSEPH DRIVES A BARGAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      A new terror leapt into Joseph's eyes at that movement of Crispin's, and
      for the third time that night did he taste the agony that is Death's
      forerunner. Yet Galliard delayed the stroke. He held his sword poised, the
      point aimed at Joseph's breast, and holding, he watched him, marking each
      phase of the terror reflected upon his livid countenance. He was loth to
      strike, for to strike would mean to end this exquisite torture of horror
      to which he was subjecting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Broken Joseph had been before and passive; now of a sudden he grew violent
      again, but in a different way. He flung himself upon his knees before Sir
      Crispin, and passionately he pleaded for the sparing of his miserable
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crispin looked on with an eye both of scorn and of cold relish. It was
      thus he wished to see him, broken and agonized, suffering thus something
      of all that which he himself had suffered through despair in the years
      that were sped. With satisfaction then he watched his victim's agony; he
      watched it too with scorn and some loathing&mdash;for a craven was in his
      eyes an ugly sight, and Joseph in that moment was truly become as vile a
      coward as ever man beheld. His parchment-like face was grey and mottled,
      his brow bedewed with sweat; his lips were blue and quivering, his eyes
      bloodshot and almost threatening tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence of one who waits stood Crispin, listening, calm and
      unmoved, as though he heard not, until Joseph's whining prayers culminated
      in an offer to make reparation. Then Crispin broke in at length with an
      impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What reparation can you make, you murderer? Can you restore to me the
      wife and child you butchered eighteen years ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can restore your child at least,&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;I can and will
      restore him to you if you but stay your hand. That and much more will I do
      to repair the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unconsciously Crispin lowered his sword-arm, and for a full minute he
      stood and stared at Joseph. His jaw was fallen and the grim firmness all
      gone from his face, and replaced by amazement, then unbelief followed by
      inquiry; then unbelief again. The pallor of his cheeks seemed to
      intensify. At last, however, he broke into a hard laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What lie is this you offer me? Zounds, man, are you not afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no lie,&rdquo; Joseph cried, in accents so earnest that some of the
      unbelief passed again from Galliard's face. &ldquo;It is the truth-God's truth.
      Your son lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell-hound, it is a lie! On that fell night, as I swooned under your
      cowardly thrust, I heard you calling to your brother to slit the squalling
      bastard's throat. Those were your very words, Master Joseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I own I bade him do it, but I was not obeyed. He swore we should give the
      babe a chance of life. It should never know whose son it was, he said, and
      I agreed. We took the boy away. He has lived and thrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knight sank on to a chair as though bereft of strength. He sought to
      think, but thinking coherently he could not. At last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall I know that you are not lying? What proof can you advance?&rdquo; he
      demanded hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear that what I have told you is true. I swear it by the cross of our
      Redeemer!&rdquo; he protested, with a solemnity that was not without effect upon
      Crispin. Nevertheless, he sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask for proofs, man, not oaths. What proofs can you afford me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the man and the woman whom the lad was reared by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where shall I find them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph opened his lips to answer, then closed them again. In his eagerness
      he had almost parted with the information which he now proposed to make
      the price of his life. He regained confidence at Crispin's tone and
      questions, gathering from both that the knight was willing to believe if
      proof were set before him. He rose to his feet, and when next he spoke his
      voice had won back much of its habitual calm deliberateness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will tell you when you have promised to go hence,
      leaving Gregory and me unharmed. I will supply you with what money you may
      need, and I will give you a letter to those people, so couched that what
      they tell you by virtue of it shall be a corroboration of my words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His elbow resting upon the table, and his hand to his brow so that it
      shaded his eyes, sat Crispin long in thought, swayed by emotions and
      doubts, the like of which he had never yet known in the whole of his
      chequered life. Was Joseph lying to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the question that repeatedly arose, and oddly enough, for all his
      mistrust of the man, he was inclined to account true the ring of his
      words. Joseph watched him with much anxiety and some hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Crispin withdrew his hands from eyes that were grown haggard,
      and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see the letter that you will write,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There you have pen,
      ink, and paper. Write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promise?&rdquo; asked Joseph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you when you have written.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a hand that shook somewhat, Joseph wrote a few lines, then handed
      Crispin the sheet, whereon he read:
    </p>
    <p>
      The bearer of this is Sir Crispin Galliard, who is intimately interested
      in the matter that lies betwixt us, and whom I pray you answer fully and
      accurately the questions he may put you in that connexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Crispin slowly. &ldquo;Yes, it will serve. Now the
      superscription.&rdquo; And he returned the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ashburn was himself again by now. He realized the advantage he had gained,
      and he would not easily relinquish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall add the superscription,&rdquo; said he calmly, &ldquo;when you swear to
      depart without further molesting us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin paused a moment, weighing the position well in his mind. If Joseph
      lied to him now, he would find means to return, he told himself, and so he
      took the oath demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph dipped his pen, and paused meditatively to watch a drop of ink,
      wherewith it was overladen, fall back into the horn. The briefest of
      pauses was it, yet it was not the accident it appeared to be. Hitherto
      Joseph had been as sincere as he had been earnest, intent alone upon
      saving his life at all costs, and forgetting in his fear of the present
      the dangers that the future might hold for him were Crispin Galliard still
      at large. But in that second of dipping his quill, assured that the peril
      of the moment was overcome, and that Crispin would go forth as he said,
      the devil whispered in his ear a cunning and vile suggestion. As he
      watched the drop of ink roll from his pen-point, he remembered that in
      London there dwelt at the sign of the Anchor, in Thames Street, one
      Colonel Pride, whose son this Galliard had slain, and who, did he once lay
      hands upon him, was not like to let him go again. In a second was the
      thought conceived and the determination taken, and as he folded the letter
      and set upon it the superscription, Joseph felt that he could have cried
      out in his exultation at the cunning manner in which he was outwitting his
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crispin took the package, and read thereon:
    </p>
    <p>
      This is to Mr. Henry Lane, at the sign of the Anchor, Thames Street,
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name was a fictitious one&mdash;one that Joseph had set down upon the
      spur of the moment, his intention being to send a messenger that should
      outstrip Sir Crispin, and warn Colonel Pride of his coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; was Crispin's only comment. He, too, was grown calm again
      and fully master of himself. He placed the letter carefully within the
      breast of his doublet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have lied to me, if this is but a shift to win your miserable
      life, rest assured, Master Ashburn, that you have but put off the day for
      a very little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was on Joseph's lips to answer that none of us are immortal, but he
      bethought him that the pleasantry might be ill-timed, and bowed in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galliard took his hat and cloak from the chair on which he had placed them
      upon descending that evening. Then he turned again to Joseph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke of money a moment ago,&rdquo; he said, in the tones of one demanding
      what is his own the tones of a gentleman speaking to his steward. &ldquo;I will
      take two hundred Caroluses. More I cannot carry in comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph gasped at the amount. For a second it even entered his mind to
      resist the demand. Then he remembered that there was a brace of pistols in
      his study; if he could get those he would settle matters there and then
      without the aid of Colonel Pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will fetch the money,&rdquo; said he, betraying his purpose by his alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By your leave, Master Ashburn, I will come with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph's eyes flashed him a quick look of baffled hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; said he, with an ill grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed out, Crispin turned to Kenneth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, sir, you are still in my service. See that you keep good
      watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth bent his head without replying. But Master Gregory required little
      watching. He lay a helpless, half-swooning heap upon the floor, which he
      had smeared with the blood oozing from his wounded shoulder. Even were he
      untrussed, there was little to be feared from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the brief while they were alone together, Kenneth did not so much
      as attempt to speak to him. He sat himself down upon the nearest chair,
      and with his chin in his hands and his elbows on his knees he pondered
      over the miserable predicament into which Sir Crispin had got him, and
      more bitter than ever it had been was his enmity at that moment towards
      the knight. That Galliard should be upon the eve of finding his son, and a
      sequel to the story he had heard from him that night in Worcester, was to
      Kenneth a thing of no interest or moment. Galliard had ruined him with
      these Ashburns. He could never now hope to win the hand of Cynthia, to
      achieve which he had been willing to turn both fool and knave&mdash;aye,
      had turned both. There was naught left him but to return him to the paltry
      Scottish estate of his fathers, there to meet the sneers of those who no
      doubt had heard that he was gone South to marry a great English heiress.
    </p>
    <p>
      That at such a season he could think of this but serves to prove the
      shallow nature of his feelings. A love was his that had gain and vanity
      for its foundation&mdash;in fact, it was no love at all. For what he
      accounted love for Cynthia was but the love of himself, which through
      Cynthia he sought to indulge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cursed the ill-luck that had brought Crispin into his life. He cursed
      Crispin for the evil he had suffered from him, forgetting that but for
      Crispin he would have been carrion a month ago and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep at his bitter musings was he when the door opened again to admit
      Joseph, followed by Galliard. The knight came across the hall and stooped
      to look at Gregory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may untruss him, Kenneth, when I am gone,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And in a quarter
      of an hour from now you are released from your oath to me. Fare you well,&rdquo;
       he added with unusual gentleness, and turning a glance that was almost
      regretful upon the lad. &ldquo;We are not like to meet again, but should we, I
      trust it may be in happier times. If I have harmed you in this business,
      remember that my need was great. Fare you well.&rdquo; And he held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take yourself to hell, sir!&rdquo; answered Kenneth, turning his back upon him.
      The ghost of an evil smile played round Joseph Ashburn's lips as he
      watched them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. COUNTER-PLOT
    </h2>
    <p>
      So soon as Sir Crispin had taken his departure, and whilst yet the beat of
      his horse's hoofs was to be distinguished above the driving storm of rain
      and wind without, Joseph hastened across the hall to the servants'
      quarters. There he found his four grooms slumbering deeply, their faces
      white and clammy, and their limbs twisted into odd, helpless attitudes.
      Vainly did he rain down upon them kicks and curses; arouse them he could
      not from the stupor in whose thrall they lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, seizing a lanthorn, he passed out to the stables, whence Crispin
      had lately taken his best nag, and with his own hands he saddled a horse.
      His lips were screwed into a curious smile&mdash;a smile that still
      lingered upon them when presently he retraced his steps to the room where
      his brother sat with Kenneth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his absence the lad had dressed Gregory's wound; he had induced him to
      take a little wine, and had set him upon a chair, in which he now lay
      back, white and exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The quarter of an hour is passed, sir,&rdquo; said Joseph coldly, as he
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth made no sign that he heard. He sat on like a man in a dream. His
      eyes that saw nothing were bent upon Gregory's pale, flabby face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The quarter of an hour is passed, sir,&rdquo; Joseph repeated in a louder
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth looked up, then rose and sighed, passing his hand wearily across
      his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, sir,&rdquo; he replied in a low voice. &ldquo;You mean that I must go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph waited a moment before replying. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is past midnight,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;and the weather is wild. You may
      lie here until morning, if you are so minded. But go you must then,&rdquo; he
      added sternly. &ldquo;I need scarce say, sir, that you must have no speech with
      Mistress Cynthia, nor that never again must you set foot within Castle
      Marleigh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, sir; I understand. But you deal hardly with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph raised his eyebrows in questioning surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was the victim of my oath, given when I knew not against whom my hand
      was to be lifted. Oh, sir, am I to suffer all my life for a fault that was
      not my own? You, Master Gregory,&rdquo; he cried, turning passionately to
      Cynthia's father, &ldquo;you are perchance more merciful? You understand my
      position&mdash;how I was forced into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregory opened his heavy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A plague on you, Master Stewart,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;I understand that you have
      given me a wound that will take a month to heal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an accident, sir. I swear it was an accident!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To swear this and that appears to be your chief diversion in life,&rdquo;
       growled Gregory for answer. &ldquo;You had best go; we are not likely to listen
      to excuses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you rather suggest a remedy,&rdquo; Joseph put in quietly, &ldquo;we might hear
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth swung round and faced him, hope brightening his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What remedy is there? How can I undo what I have done? Show me but the
      way, and I'll follow it, no matter where it leads!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such protestations had Joseph looked to hear, and he was hard put to it to
      dissemble his satisfaction. For a while he was silent, making pretence to
      ponder. At length:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kenneth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you may in some measure repair the evil you have
      done, and if you are ready to undergo some slight discomfort, I shall be
      willing on my side to forget this night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how, sir, and whatever the cost I will perform it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave no thought to the fact that Crispin's grievance against the
      Ashburns was well-founded; that they had wrecked his life even as they had
      sought to destroy it; even as eighteen years ago they had destroyed his
      wife's. His only thought was Cynthia; his only wish was to possess her.
      Besides that, justice and honour itself were of small account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is but a slight matter,&rdquo; answered Joseph. &ldquo;A matter that I might
      entrust to one of my grooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That whilst his grooms lay drugged the matter was so pressing that his
      messenger must set out that very night, Joseph did not think of adding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would, sir,&rdquo; answered the boy, &ldquo;that the task were great and
      difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; answered Joseph with biting sarcasm, &ldquo;we are acquainted with
      both your courage and your resource.&rdquo; He sat silent and thoughtful for
      some moments, then with a sudden sharp glance at the lad:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have this chance of setting yourself right with us,&rdquo; he said.
      Then abruptly he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go make ready for a journey. You must set out within the hour for London.
      Take what you may require and arm yourself; then return to me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregory, who, despite his sluggish wits, divined&mdash;partly, at least&mdash;what
      was afoot, made shift to speak. But his brother silenced him with a
      glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; Joseph said to the boy. And, without comment, Kenneth rose and left
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; asked Gregory when the door had closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make doubly sure of that ruffian,&rdquo; answered Joseph coldly. &ldquo;Colonel Pride
      might be absent when he arrives, and he might learn that none of the name
      of Lane dwells at the Anchor in Thames Street. It would be fatal to awaken
      his suspicions and bring him back to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely Richard or Stephen might carry your errand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They might were they not so drugged that they cannot be aroused. I might
      even go myself, but it is better so.&rdquo; He laughed softly. &ldquo;There is even
      comedy in it. Kenneth shall outride our bloodthirsty knight to warn Pride
      of his coming, and when he comes he will walk into the hands of the
      hangman. It will be a surprise for him. For the rest I shall keep my
      promise concerning his son. He shall have news of him from Pride&mdash;but
      when too late to be of service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregory shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fore God, Joseph, 'tis a foul thing you do,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Sooner would I
      never set eyes on the lad again. Let him go his ways as you intended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did intend it. What trustier messenger could I find now that I
      have lent him zest by fright? To win Cynthia, we may rely upon him safely
      to do that in which another might fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph, you will roast in hell for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph laughed him to scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To bed with you, you canting hypocrite; your wound makes you
      light-headed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a half-hour ere Kenneth returned, booted, cloaked, and ready for
      his journey. He found Joseph alone, busily writing, and in obedience to a
      sign he sat him down to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes passed, then, with a final scratch and splutter Joseph flung
      down his pen. With the sandbox tilted in the air, like a dicer about to
      make his throw, he looked at the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will spare neither whip nor spur until you arrive in London, Master
      Kenneth. You must ride night and day; the matter is of the greatest
      urgency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth nodded that he understood, and Joseph sprinkled the sand over the
      written page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not when you should reach London so that you may be in time, but,&rdquo;
       he continued, and as he spoke he creased the paper and poured the
      superfluous sand back into the box, &ldquo;I should say that by midnight
      to-morrow your message should be delivered. Aye,&rdquo; he continued, in answer
      to the lad's gasp of surprise, &ldquo;it is hard riding, I know, but if you
      would win Cynthia you must do it. Spare neither money nor horseflesh, and
      keep to the saddle until you are in Thames Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He folded the letter, sealed it, and wrote the superscription: &ldquo;This to
      Colonel Pride, at the sign of the Anchor in Thames Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and handed the package to Kenneth, to whom the superscription
      meant nothing, since he had not seen that borne by the letter which
      Crispin had received.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will deliver this intact, and with your own hands, to Colonel Pride
      in person&mdash;none other. Should he be absent from Thames Street upon
      your arrival, seek him out instantly, wherever he may be, and give him
      this. Upon your faithful observance of these conditions remember that your
      future depends. If you are in time, as indeed I trust and think you will
      be, you may account yourself Cynthia's husband. Fail and&mdash;well, you
      need not return here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not fail, sir,&rdquo; cried Kenneth. &ldquo;What man can do to accomplish the
      journey within twenty-four hours, I will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have stopped to thank Joseph for the signal favour of this chance
      of rehabilitation, but Joseph cut him short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this purse,&rdquo; he cried impatiently. &ldquo;You will find a horse ready
      saddled in the stables. Ride it hard. It will bear you to Norton at least.
      There get you a fresh one, and when that is done, another. Now be off.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XIX. THE INTERRUPTED JOURNEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the Tavern Knight left the gates of Marleigh Park behind him on that
      wild October night, he drove deep the rowels of his spurs, and set his
      horse at a perilous gallop along the road to Norwich. The action was of
      instinct rather than of thought. In the turbulent sea of his mind, one
      clear current there was, and one only&mdash;the knowledge that he was
      bound for London for news of this son of his whom Joseph told him lived.
      He paused not even to speculate what manner of man his child was grown,
      nor yet what walk of life he had been reared to tread. He lived: he was
      somewhere in the world; that for the time sufficed him. The Ashburns had
      not, it seemed, destroyed quite everything that made his life worth
      enduring&mdash;the life that so often and so wantonly he had exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His son lived, and in London he should have news of him. To London then
      must he get himself with all dispatch, and he swore to take no rest until
      he reached it. And with that firm resolve to urge him, he ploughed his
      horse's flanks, and sped on through the night. The rain beat in his face,
      yet he scarce remarked it, as again more by instinct than by reason&mdash;he
      buried his face to the eyes in the folds of his cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later the rain ceased, and clearer grew the line of light betwixt the
      hedgerows, by which his horse had steered its desperate career. Fitfully a
      crescent moon peered out from among the wind-driven clouds. The poor
      ruffler was fallen into meditation, and noted not that his nag did no more
      than amble. He roused himself of a sudden when half-way down a gentle
      slope some five miles from Norwich, and out of temper at discovering the
      sluggishness of the pace, he again gave the horse a taste of the spurs.
      The action was fatal. The incline was become a bed of sodden clay, and he
      had not noticed with what misgivings his horse pursued the treacherous
      footing. The sting of the spur made the animal bound forward, and the next
      instant a raucous oath broke from Crispin as the nag floundered and
      dropped on its knees. Like a stone from a catapult Galliard flew over its
      head and rolled down the few remaining yards of the slope into a very lake
      of slimy water at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down this same hill, some twenty minutes later, came Kenneth Stewart with
      infinite precaution. He was in haste&mdash;a haste more desperate far than
      even Crispin's. But his character held none of Galliard's recklessness,
      nor were his wits fogged by such news as Crispin had heard that night. He
      realized that to be swift he must be cautious in his night-riding. And so,
      carefully he came, with a firm hand on the reins, yet leaving it to his
      horse to find safe footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had reached the level ground in safety, and was about to put his nag to
      a smarter pace, when of a sudden from the darkness of the hedge he was
      hailed by a harsh, metallic voice, the sound of which sent a tremor
      through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you are choicely met, whoever you may be. I have suffered a
      mischance down that cursed hill, and my horse has gone lame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth kept his cloak over his mouth, trusting that the muffling would
      sufficiently disguise his accents as he made answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in haste, my master. What is your will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, marry, so am I in haste. My will is your horse, sir. Oh, I'm no
      robber. I'll pay you for it, and handsomely. But have it I must. 'Twill be
      no great discomfort for you to walk to Norwich. You may do it in an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My horse, sir, is not for sale,&rdquo; was Kenneth's brief answer. &ldquo;Give you
      good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold, man! Blood and hell, stop! If you'll not sell the worthless beast
      to serve a gentleman, I'll shoot it under you. Make your choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth caught the gleam of a pistol-barrel pointed at him from the hedge,
      and he shivered. What was he to do? Every instant was precious to him. As
      in a flash it came to him that perchance Sir Crispin also rode to London,
      and that it was expected of him to arrive there first if he were to be in
      time. Swiftly he weighed the odds in his mind, and took the determination
      to dash past Sir Crispin, risking his aim and trusting to the dark to
      befriend him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even as he determined thus, what moon there was became unveiled, and
      the light of it fell upon his face, which was turned towards Galliard. An
      exclamation of surprise escaped Sir Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Slife, Master Stewart, I knew not your voice. Whither do you ride?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it to you? Have you not wrought enough of evil for me? Am I never
      to be rid of you? Castle Marleigh,&rdquo; he added, with well-feigned anger,
      &ldquo;has closed its doors upon me. What does it signify to you whither I ride?
      Suffer me leastways to pass unmolested, and to leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth's passionate reproaches cut Galliard keenly. He held himself at
      that moment a very knave for having dragged this boy into his work of
      vengeance, and thereby cast a blight upon his life. He sought for words
      wherein to give expression to something of what he felt, then realizing
      how futile and effete all words must prove, he waved his hand in the
      direction of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, Master Stewart,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Your way is clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Kenneth, waiting for no second invitation, rode on and left him. He
      rode with gratitude in his heart to the Providence that had caused him so
      easily to overcome an obstacle that at first he had held impassable.
      Stronger grew in his mind the conviction that to fulfil the mission Joseph
      required of him, he must reach London before Sir Crispin. The knowledge
      that he was ahead of him, and that he must derive an ample start from
      Galliard's mishap, warmed him like wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind thus relieved from its weight of anxiety, he little recked
      fatigue, and such excellent use did he make of his horse that he reached
      Newmarket on it an hour before the morrow's moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour he rested there, and broke his fast. Then on a fresh horse&mdash;a
      powerful and willing animal he set out once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      By half-past two he was at Newport. But so hard had he ridden that man and
      beast alike were in a lather of sweat, and whilst he himself felt sick and
      tired, the horse was utterly unfit to bear him farther. For half an hour
      he rested there, and made a meal whose chief constituent was brandy. Then
      on a third horse he started upon the last stage of his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was damp and penetrating; the roads veritable morasses of mud,
      and overhead gloomy banks of dark, grey clouds moved sluggishly, the light
      that was filtered through them giving the landscape a bleak and dreary
      aspect. In his jaded condition Kenneth soon became a prey to the
      depression of it. His lightness of heart of some dozen hours ago was now
      all gone, and not even the knowledge that his mission was well-nigh
      accomplished sufficed to cheer him. To add to his discomfort a fine rain
      set in towards four o'clock, and when a couple of hours later he clattered
      along the road cut through a wooded slope in the direction of Waltham, he
      was become a very limp and lifeless individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed not the horsemen moving cautiously among the closely-set trees
      on either side of the road. It was growing prematurely dark, and objects
      were none too distinct. And thus it befell that when from the reverie of
      dejection into which he had fallen he was suddenly aroused by the thud of
      hoofs, he looked up to find two mounted men barring the road some ten
      yards in front of him. Their attitude was unmistakable, and it crossed
      poor Kenneth's mind that he was beset by robbers. But a second glance
      showed him their red cloaks and military steel caps, and he knew them for
      soldiers of the Commonwealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the beat of hoofs behind him, he looked over his shoulder to see
      four other troopers closing rapidly down upon him. Clearly he was the
      object of their attention. He had been a fool not to have perceived this
      earlier, and his heart misgave him, for all that had he paused to think he
      must have realized that he had naught to fear, and that in this some
      mistake must lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; thundered the deep voice of the sergeant, who, with a trooper,
      held the road in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth drew up within a yard of them, conscious that the man's dark eyes
      were scanning him sharply from beneath his morion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, sir?&rdquo; the bass voice demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas for the vanity of poor human mites! Even Kenneth, who never yet had
      achieved aught for the cause he served, grew of a sudden chill to think
      that perchance this sergeant might recognize his name for one that he had
      heard before associated with deeds performed on the King's behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second he hesitated; then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blount,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;Jasper Blount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He little thought how that fruit of his vanity was to prove his undoing
      thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; sneered the sergeant, &ldquo;it almost seemed you had forgotten it.&rdquo;
       And from that sneer Kenneth gathered with fresh dread that the fellow
      mistrusted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whence are you, Master Blount?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Kenneth hesitated. Then recalling Ashburn's high favour with the
      Parliament, and seeing that it could but advance his cause to state the
      true sum of his journey:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Castle Marleigh,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verily, sir, you seem yet in some doubt. Whither do you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what errand?&rdquo; The sergeant's questions fell swift as sword-strokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With letters for Colonel Pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply, delivered more boldly than Kenneth had spoken hitherto, was not
      without its effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whom are these letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Mr. Joseph Ashburn, of Castle Marleigh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Produce them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With trembling fingers Kenneth complied. This the sergeant observed as he
      took the package.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails you, man?&rdquo; quoth he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naught, sir 'tis the cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant scanned the package and its seal. In a measure it was a
      passport, and he was forced to the conclusion that this man was indeed the
      messenger he represented himself. Certainly he had not the air nor the
      bearing of him for whom they waited, nor did the sergeant think that their
      quarry would have armed himself with a dummy package against such a
      strait. And yet the sergeant was not master after all, and did he let this
      fellow pursue his journey, he might reap trouble for it hereafter; whilst
      likewise if he detained him, Colonel Pride, he knew, was not an
      over-patient man. He was still debating what course to take, and had
      turned to his companion with the muttered question: &ldquo;What think you,
      Peter?&rdquo; when by his precipitancy Kenneth ruined his slender chance of
      being permitted to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, sir, now that you know my errand, suffer me to pass on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an eager tremor in his voice that the sergeant mistook for fear.
      He noted it, and remembering the boy's hesitancy in answering his earlier
      questions, he decided upon his course of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall not delay your journey, sir,&rdquo; he answered, eyeing Kenneth
      sharply, &ldquo;and as your way must lie through Waltham, I will but ask you to
      suffer us to ride with you thus far, so that there you may answer any
      questions our captain may have to ask ere you proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more, master courier,&rdquo; snarled the sergeant. Then, beckoning a trooper
      to his side, he whispered an order in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the man withdrew they wheeled their horses, and at a sharp word of
      command Kenneth rode on towards Waltham between the sergeant and a
      trooper.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. THE CONVERTED HOGAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Night black and impenetrable had set in ere Kenneth and his escort
      clattered over the greasy stones of Waltham's High Street, and drew up in
      front of the Crusader Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door stood wide and hospitable, and a warm shaft of light fell from it
      and set a glitter upon the wet street. Avoiding the common-room, the
      sergeant led Kenneth through the inn-yard, and into the hostelry by a side
      entrance. He urged the youth along a dimly-lighted passage. On a door at
      the end of this he knocked, then, lifting the latch, he ushered Kenneth
      into a roomy, oak-panelled chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the far end a huge fire burnt cheerfully, and with his back to it, his
      feet planted wide apart upon the hearth, stood a powerfully built man of
      medium height, whose youthful face and uprightness of carriage assorted
      ill with the grey of his hair, pronouncing that greyness premature. He
      seemed all clad in leather, for where his jerkin stopped his boots began.
      A cuirass and feathered headpiece lay in a corner, whilst on the table
      Kenneth espied a broad-brimmed hat, a huge sword, and a brace of pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the boy's eyes came back to the burly figure on the hearth, he was
      puzzled by a familiar, intangible something in the fellow's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was racking his mind to recall where last he had seen it, when with
      slightly elevated eyebrows and a look of recognition in his somewhat
      prominent blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soul of my body,&rdquo; exclaimed the man in surprise, &ldquo;Master Stewart, as I
      live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuart!&rdquo; cried both sergeant and trooper in a gasp, starting forward to
      scan their prisoner's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that the burly captain broke into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the young man Charles Stuart,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;no, no. Your captive is none
      so precious. It is only Master Kenneth Stewart, of Bailienochy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is not even our man,&rdquo; grumbled the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Stewart is not the name he gave,&rdquo; cried the sergeant. &ldquo;Jasper Blount
      he told me he was called. It seems that after all we have captured a
      malignant, and that I was well advised to bring him to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain made a gesture of disdain. In that moment Kenneth recognized
      him. He was Harry Hogan&mdash;the man whose life Galliard had saved in
      Penrith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah, a worthless capture, Beddoes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not that,&rdquo; retorted the sergeant. &ldquo;He carries papers which he
      states are from Joseph Ashburn, of Castle Marleigh, to Colonel Pride.
      Colonel Pride's name is on the package, but may not that be a subterfuge?
      Why else did he say he was called Blount?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan's brows were of a sudden knit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, Beddoes, you are right. Remove his sword and search him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calmly Kenneth suffered them to carry out this order. Inwardly he boiled
      at the delay, and cursed himself for having so needlessly given the name
      of Blount. But for that, it was likely Hogan would have straightway
      dismissed him. He cheered himself with the thought that after all they
      would not long detain him. Their search made, and finding nothing upon him
      but Ashburn's letter, surely they would release him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their search was very thorough. They drew off his boots, and well-nigh
      stripped him naked, submitting each article of his apparel to a careful
      examination. At length it was over, and Hogan held Ashburn's package,
      turning it over in his hands with a thoughtful expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, sir, you will now allow me to proceed,&rdquo; cried Kenneth. &ldquo;I assure
      you the matter is of the greatest urgency, and unless I am in London by
      midnight I shall be too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late for what?&rdquo; asked Hogan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; The Irishman laughed unpleasantly. Colonel Pride and he were on
      anything but the best of terms. The colonel knew him for a godless soldier
      of fortune bound to the Parliament's cause by no interest beyond that of
      gain; and, himself a zealot, Colonel Pride had with distasteful frequency
      shown Hogan the quality of his feelings towards him. That Hogan was not
      afraid of him, was because it was not in Hogan's nature to be afraid of
      anyone. But he realized at least that he had cause to be, and at the
      present moment it occurred to him that it would be passing sweet to find a
      flaw in the old Puritan's armour. If the package were harmless his having
      opened it was still a matter that the discharge of his duty would
      sanction. Thus he reasoned; and he resolved to break the seal and make
      himself master of the contents of that letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogan's unpleasant laugh startled Kenneth. It suggested to him that
      perhaps, after all, his delay was by no means at an end; that Hogan
      suspected him of something&mdash;he could not think of what.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in a flash an idea came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I speak to you privately for a moment, Captain Hogan?&rdquo; he inquired in
      such a tone of importance&mdash;imperiousness, almost&mdash;that the
      Irishman was impressed by it. He scented disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, you may if you have aught to tell me,&rdquo; and he signed to Beddoes
      and his companion to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Master Hogan,&rdquo; Kenneth began resolutely as soon as they were alone,
      &ldquo;I ask you to let me go my way unmolested. Too long already has the
      stupidity of your followers detained me here unjustly. That I reach London
      by midnight is to me a matter of the gravest moment, and you shall let
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soul of my body, Mr. Stewart, what a spirit you have acquired since last
      we met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your place I should leave our last meeting unmentioned, master
      turncoat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Irishman's eyebrows shot up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Mass, young cockerel, I mislike your tone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have cause to dislike it more if you detain me.&rdquo; He was desperate
      now. &ldquo;What would your saintly, crop-eared friends say if they knew as much
      of your past history as I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis a matter for conjecture,&rdquo; said Hogan, humouring him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How think you would they welcome the story of the roystering rake and
      debauchee who deserted the army of King Charles because they were about to
      hang him for murder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! how, indeed?&rdquo; sighed Hogan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What manner of reputation, think you, that for a captain of the godly
      army of the Commonwealth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vile one, truly,&rdquo; murmured Hogan with humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Mr. Hogan,&rdquo; he wound up loftily, &ldquo;you had best return me that
      package, and be rid of me before I sow mischief enough to bring you a crop
      of hemp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan stared at the lad's flushed face with a look of whimsical
      astonishment, and for a brief spell there was silence between them. Slowly
      then, with his eyes still fixed upon Kenneth's, the captain unsheathed a
      dagger. The boy drew back, with a sudden cry of alarm. Hogan vented a
      horse-laugh, and ran the blade under the seal of Ashburn's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not afraid, my man of threats,&rdquo; he said pleasantly. &ldquo;I have no thought
      of hurting you&mdash;leastways, not yet.&rdquo; He paused in the act of breaking
      the seal. &ldquo;Lest you should treasure uncomfortable delusions, dear Master
      Stewart, let me remind you that I am an Irishman&mdash;not a fool. Do you
      conceive my fame to be so narrow a thing that when I left the beggarly
      army of King Charles for that of the Commonwealth, I did not realize how
      at any moment I might come face to face with someone who had heard of my
      old exploits, and would denounce me? You do not find me masquerading under
      an assumed name. I am here, sir, as Harry Hogan, a sometime dissolute
      follower of the Egyptian Pharaoh, Charles Stuart; an erstwhile besotted,
      blinded soldier in the army of the Amalekite, a whilom erring malignant,
      but converted by a crowning mercy into a zealous, faithful servant of
      Israel. There were vouchsafings and upliftings, and the devil knows what
      else, when this stray lamb was gathered to the fold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He uttered the words with a nasal intonation, and a whimsical look at
      Kenneth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Stewart, tell them what you will, and they will tell you yet
      more in return, to show you how signally the light of grace hath been shed
      over me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again, and broke the seal. Kenneth, crestfallen and abashed,
      watched him, without attempting further interference. Of what avail?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had been better advised, young sir, had you been less hasty and
      anxious. It is a fatal fault of youth's, and one of which nothing but time&mdash;if,
      indeed, you live&mdash;will cure you. Your anxiety touching this package
      determines me to open it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth sneered at the man's conclusions, and, shrugging his shoulders,
      turned slightly aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perchance, master wiseacres, when you have read it, you will appreciate
      how egotism may also lead men into fatal errors. Haply, too, you will be
      able to afford Colonel Pride some satisfactory reason for tampering with
      his correspondence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Hogan heard him not. He had unfolded the letter, and at the first
      words he beheld, a frown contracted his brows. As he read on the frown
      deepened, and when he had done, an oath broke from his lips. &ldquo;God's life!&rdquo;
       he cried, then again was silent, and so stood a moment with bent head. At
      last he raised his eyes, and let them rest long and searchingly upon
      Kenneth, who now observed him in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; the lad asked, with hesitancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hogan never answered. He strode past him to the door, and flung it
      wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beddoes!&rdquo; he called. A step sounded in the passage, and the sergeant
      appeared. &ldquo;Have you a trooper there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Peter, who rode with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him look to this fellow. Tell him to set him under lock and bolt here
      in the inn until I shall want him, and tell him that he shall answer for
      him with his neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth drew back in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir&mdash;Captain Hogan&mdash;will you explain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry, you shall have explanations to spare before morning, else I'm a
      fool. But have no fear, for we intend you no hurt,&rdquo; he added more softly.
      &ldquo;Take him away, Beddoes; then return to me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Beddoes came back from consigning Kenneth into the hands of his
      trooper, he found Hogan seated in the leathern arm-chair, with Ashburn's
      letter spread before him on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was right in my suspicions, eh?&rdquo; ventured Beddoes complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were more than right, Beddoes, you were Heaven-inspired. It is no
      State matter that you have chanced upon, but one that touches a man in
      whom I am interested very nearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant's eyes were full of questions, but Hogan enlightened him no
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will ride back to your post at once, Beddoes,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Should
      Lord Oriel fall into your hands, as we hope, you will send him to me. But
      you will continue to patrol the road, and demand the business of all
      comers. I wish one Crispin Galliard, who should pass this way ere long,
      detained, and brought to me. He is a tall, lank man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him, sir,&rdquo; Beddoes interrupted. &ldquo;The Tavern Knight they called him
      in the malignant army&mdash;a rakehelly, dissolute brawler. I saw him in
      Worcester when he was taken after the fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan frowned. The righteous Beddoes knew overmuch. &ldquo;That is the man,&rdquo; he
      answered calmly. &ldquo;Go now, and see that he does not ride past you. I have
      great and urgent need of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beddoes' eyes were opened in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is possessed of valuable information,&rdquo; Hogan explained. &ldquo;Away with
      you, man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When alone, Harry Hogan turned his arm-chair sideways towards the fire.
      Then, filling himself a pipe&mdash;for in his foreign campaigning he had
      acquired the habit of tobacco-smoking&mdash;he stretched his sinewy legs
      across a second chair, and composed himself for meditation. An hour went
      by; the host looked in to see if the captain required anything. Another
      hour sped on, and the captain dozed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awoke with a start. The fire had burned low, and the hands of the huge
      clock in the corner pointed to midnight. From the passage came to him the
      sound of steps and angry voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Hogan could rise, the door was flung wide, and a tall, gaunt man
      was hustled across the threshold by two soldiers. His head was bare, and
      his hair wet and dishevelled. His doublet was torn and his shoulder
      bleeding, whilst his empty scabbard hung like a lambent tail behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have brought him, captain,&rdquo; one of the men announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, you crop-eared, psalm-whining cuckolds, you've brought me, d&mdash;n
      you,&rdquo; growled Sir Crispin, whose eyes rolled fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his angry glance lighted upon Hogan's impressive face, he abruptly
      stemmed the flow of invective that rushed to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Irishman rose, and looked past him at the troopers. &ldquo;Leave us,&rdquo; he
      commanded shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained standing by the hearth until the footsteps of his men had died
      away, then he crossed the chamber, passed Crispin without a word, and
      quietly locked the door. That done, he turned a friendly smile on his
      tanned face&mdash;and holding out his hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, Cris, it is mine to thank you and to repay you in some measure
      for the service you rendered me that night at Penrith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2HCH0021" id="link2HCH0021">

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. THE MESSAGE KENNETH BORE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In bewilderment Crispin took the outstretched hand of his old
      fellow-roysterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oddslife,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;if to have me waylaid, dragged from my horse and
      wounded by those sons of dogs, your myrmidons, be your manner of
      expressing gratitude, I'd as lief you had let me go unthanked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, Cris, I dare swear you'll thank me before another hour is sped.
      Ough, man, how cold you are! There's a bottle of strong waters yonder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, without completing his sentence, Hogan had seized the black jack and
      poured half a glass of its contents, which he handed Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink, man,&rdquo; he said briefly, and Crispin, nothing loath, obeyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next Hogan drew the torn and sodden doublet from his guest's back, pushed
      a chair over to the table, and bade him sit. Again, nothing loath, Crispin
      did as he was bidden. He was stiff from long riding, and so with a sigh of
      satisfaction he settled himself down and stretched out his long legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogan slowly took the seat opposite to him, and coughed. He was at a loss
      how to open the parlous subject, how to communicate to Crispin the amazing
      news upon which he had stumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slife' Hogan,&rdquo; laughed Crispin dreamily, &ldquo;I little thought it was to you
      those crop-ears carried me with such violence. I little thought, indeed,
      ever to see you again. But you have prospered, you knave, since that night
      you left Penrith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he turned his head the better to survey the Irishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, I have prospered,&rdquo; Hogan assented. &ldquo;My life is a sort of parable of
      the fatted son and the prodigal calf. They tell me there is greater joy in
      heaven over the repentance of a sinner than&mdash;than&mdash;Plague on it!
      How does it go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than over the downfall of a saint?&rdquo; suggested Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll swear that's not the text, but any of my troopers could quote it
      you; every man of them is an incarnate Church militant.&rdquo; He paused, and
      Crispin laughed softly. Then abruptly: &ldquo;And so you were riding to London?&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How know you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I know more&mdash;much more. I can even tell you to what house you
      rode, and on what errand. You were for the sign of the Anchor in Thames
      Street, for news of your son, whom Joseph Ashburn hath told you lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin sat bolt upright, a look of mingled wonder and suspicion on his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are well informed, you gentlemen of the Parliament,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the matter of your errand,&rdquo; the Irishman returned quietly, &ldquo;I am much
      better informed than are you. Shall I tell you who lives at the sign of
      the Anchor&mdash;not whom you have been told lives there, but who really
      does occupy the house?&rdquo; Hogan paused a second as though awaiting some
      reply; then softly he answered his own question: &ldquo;Colonel Pride.&rdquo; And he
      sat back to await results.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were none. For the moment the name awoke no recollections, conveyed
      no meaning to Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who may Colonel Pride be?&rdquo; he asked, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogan was visibly disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A certain powerful and vindictive member of the Rump, whose son you
      killed at Worcester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time the shaft went home. Galliard sprang out of the chair, his brows
      darkening, and his cheeks pale beyond their wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zounds, Hogan, do you mean that Joseph Ashburn was betraying me into this
      man's hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin stopped short. The pallor of his face increased; it became ashen,
      and his eyes glittered as though a fever consumed him. He sank back into
      his chair, and setting both hands upon the table before him, he looked
      straight at Hogan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my son, Hogan, my son?&rdquo; he pleaded, and his voice was broken as no
      man had heard it yet. &ldquo;Oh, God in heaven!&rdquo; he cried in a sudden frenzy.
      &ldquo;What hell's work is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Behind his blue lips his teeth were chattering now. His hands shook as he
      held them, still clenched, before him. Then, in a dull, concentrated
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogan,&rdquo; he vowed, &ldquo;I'll kill him for it. Fool, blind, pitiful fool that I
      am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then&mdash;his face distorted by passion&mdash;he broke into a torrent of
      imprecations that was at length stemmed by Hogan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Cris,&rdquo; said he, laying his hand upon the other's arm. &ldquo;It is not
      all false. Joseph Ashburn sought, it is true, to betray you into the hands
      of Colonel Pride, sending you to the sign of the Anchor with the assurance
      that there you should have news of your son. That was false; yet not all
      false. Your son does live, and at the sign of the Anchor it is likely you
      would have had the news of him you sought. But that news would have come
      when too late to have been of value to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin tried to speak, but failed. Then, mastering himself by an effort,
      and in a voice that was oddly shaken:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogan,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you are torturing me! What is the sum of your
      knowledge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last the Irishman produced Ashburn's letter to Colonel Pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are patrolling the roads in wait for a malignant that
      has incurred the Parliament's displeasure. We have news that he is making
      for Harwich, where a vessel lies waiting to carry him to France, and we
      expect that he will ride this way. Three hours ago a young man unable
      clearly to account for himself rode into our net, and was brought to me.
      He was the bearer of a letter to Colonel Pride from Joseph Ashburn. He had
      given my sergeant a wrong name, and betrayed such anxiety to be gone that
      I deemed his errand a suspicious one, and broke the seal of that letter.
      You may thank God, Galliard, every night of your life that I did so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was this youth Kenneth Stewart?&rdquo; asked Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have guessed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;n the lad,&rdquo; he began furiously. Then repressing himself, he
      sighed, and in an altered tone, &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have grievously
      wronged him! have wrecked his life&mdash;or at least he thinks so now. I
      can hardly blame him for seeking to be quits with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lad,&rdquo; returned Hogan, &ldquo;must be himself a dupe. He can have had no
      suspicion of the message he carried. Let me read it to you; it will make
      all clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan drew a taper nearer, and spreading the paper upon the table, he
      smoothed it out, and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      HONOURED SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      The bearer of the present should, if he rides well, outstrip another
      messenger I have dispatched to you upon a fool's errand, with a letter
      addressed to one Mr. Lane at the sign of the Anchor. The bearer of that is
      none other than the notorious malignant, Sir Crispin Galliard, by whose
      hand your son was slain under your very eyes at Worcester, whose capture I
      know that you warmly desire and with whom I doubt not you will know how to
      deal. To us he has been a source of no little molestation; his liberty, in
      fact, is a perpetual menace to our lives. For some eighteen years this
      Galliard has believed dead a son that my cousin bore him. News of this
      son, whom I have just informed him lives&mdash;as indeed he does&mdash;is
      the bait wherewith I have lured him to your address. Forewarned by the
      present, I make no doubt you will prepare to receive him fittingly. But
      ere that justice he escaped at Worcester be meted out to him at Tyburn or
      on Tower Hill, I would have you give him that news touching his son which
      I am sending him to you to receive. Inform him, sir, that his son, Jocelyn
      Marleigh...
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogan paused, and shot a furtive glance at Galliard. The knight was
      leaning forward now, his eyes strained, his forehead beaded with
      perspiration, and his breathing heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read on,&rdquo; he begged hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      His son, Jocelyn Marleigh, is the bearer of this letter, the man whom he
      has injured and who detests him, the youth with whom he has, by a curious
      chance, been in much close association, and whom he has known as Kenneth
      Stewart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; gasped Crispin. Then with sudden vigour, &ldquo;Oh, 'tis a lie,&rdquo; he
      cried, &ldquo;a fresh invention of that lying brain to torture me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan held up his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a little more,&rdquo; he said, and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      Should he doubt this, bid him look closely into the lad's face, and ask
      him, after he has scrutinized it, what image it evokes. Should he still
      doubt thereafter, thinking the likeness to which he has been singularly
      blind to be no more than accidental, bid them strip the lad's right foot.
      It bears a mark that I think should convince him. For the rest, honoured
      sir, I beg you to keep all information touching his parentage from the boy
      himself, wherein I have weighty ends to serve. Within a few days of your
      receipt of this letter, I look to have the honour of waiting upon you. In
      the meanwhile, honoured sir, believe that while I am, I am your obedient
      servant,

      JOSEPH ASHBURN
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the narrow table the two men's glances met&mdash;Hogan's full of
      concern and pity, Crispin's charged with amazement and horror. A little
      while they sat thus, then Crispin rose slowly to his feet, and with steps
      uncertain as a drunkard's he crossed to the window. He pushed it open, and
      let the icy wind upon his face and head, unconscious of its sting. Moments
      passed, during which the knight went over the last few months of his
      turbulent life since his first meeting at Perth with Kenneth Stewart. He
      recalled how strangely and unaccountably he had been drawn to the boy when
      first he beheld him in the castle yard, and how, owing to a feeling for
      which he could not account, since the lad's character had little that
      might commend him to such a man as Crispin, he had contrived that Kenneth
      should serve in his company.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recalled how at first&mdash;aye, and often afterwards even&mdash;he had
      sought to win the boy's affection, despite the fact that there was naught
      in the boy that he truly admired, and much that he despised. Was it
      possible that these his feelings were dictated by Nature to his
      unconscious mind? It must indeed be so, and the written words of Joseph
      Ashburn to Colonel Pride were true. Kenneth was indeed his son; the
      conviction was upon him. He conjured up the lad's face, and a cry of
      discovery escaped him. How blind he had been not to have seen before the
      likeness of Alice&mdash;his poor, butchered girl-wife of eighteen years
      ago. How dull never before to have realized that that likeness it was had
      drawn him to the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was calm by now, and in his calm he sought to analyse his thoughts, and
      he was shocked to find that they were not joyous. He yearned&mdash;as he
      had yearned that night in Worcester&mdash;for the lad's affection, and
      yet, for all his yearning, he realized that with the conviction that
      Kenneth was his offspring came a dull sense of disappointment. He was not
      such a son as the rakehelly knight would have had him. Swiftly he put the
      thought from him. The craven hands that had reared the lad had warped his
      nature; he would guide it henceforth; he would straighten it out into a
      nobler shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he smiled bitterly to himself. What manner of man was he to train a
      youth to loftiness and honour?&mdash;he, a debauched ruler with a nickname
      for which, had he any sense of shame, he would have blushed! Again he
      remembered the lad's disposition towards himself; but these, he thought,
      he hoped, he knew that he would now be able to overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the window, and turned to face his companion. He was himself
      again, and calm, for all that his face was haggard beyond its wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogan, where is the boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have detained him in the inn. Will you see him now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once, Hogan. I am convinced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Irishman crossed the chamber, and opening the door he called an order
      to the trooper waiting in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes they waited, standing, with no word uttered between them. At
      last steps sounded in the corridor, and a moment later Kenneth was rudely
      thrust into the room. Hogan signed to the trooper, who closed the door and
      withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Kenneth entered, Crispin advanced a step and paused, his eyes devouring
      the lad and receiving in exchange a glance that was full of malevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have known, sir, that you were not far away,&rdquo; he exclaimed
      bitterly, forgetting for the moment how he had left Crispin behind him on
      the previous night. &ldquo;I might have guessed that my detention was your
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; asked Crispin quietly, his eyes ever scanning the lad's face
      with a pathetic look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is your way, I know not why, to work my ruin in all things.
      Not satisfied with involving me in that business at Castle Marleigh, you
      must needs cross my path again when I am about to make amends, and so
      blight my last chance. My God, sir, am I never to be rid of you? What harm
      have I done you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A spasm of pain, like a ripple over water, crossed the knight's swart
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you but consider, Kenneth,&rdquo; he said, speaking very quietly, &ldquo;you must
      see the injustice of your words. Since when has Crispin Galliard served
      the Parliament, that Roundhead troopers should do his bidding as you
      suggest? And touching that business at Sheringham you are over-hard with
      me. It was a compact you made, and but for which, you forget that you had
      been carrion these three weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to Heaven that I had been,&rdquo; the boy burst out, &ldquo;sooner than pay
      such a price for keeping my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for my presence here,&rdquo; Crispin continued, leaving the outburst
      unheeded, &ldquo;it has naught to do with your detention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan caught his breath with a sharp hiss, and a dead silence followed.
      That silence struck terror into Kenneth's heart. He encountered Crispin's
      eye bent upon him with a look he could not fathom, and much would he now
      have given to recall the two words that had burst from him in the heat of
      his rage. He bethought him of the unscrupulous, deadly character
      attributed to the man to whom he had addressed them, and in his coward's
      fancy he saw already payment demanded. Already he pictured himself lying
      cold and stark in the streets of Waltham with a sword-wound through his
      middle. His face went grey and his lips trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Galliard spoke at last, and the mildness of his tone filled Kenneth
      with a new dread. In his experience of Crispin's ways he had come to look
      upon mildness as the man's most dangerous phase:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; Crispin said. &ldquo;I spoke the truth; it is a habit of
      mine&mdash;haply the only gentlemanly habit left me. I repeat, I have had
      naught to do with your detention. I arrived here half an hour ago, as the
      captain will inform you, and I was conducted hither by force, having been
      seized by his men, even as you were seized. No,&rdquo; he added, with a sigh,
      &ldquo;it was not my hand that detained you; it was the hand of Fate.&rdquo; Then
      suddenly changing his voice to a more vehement key, &ldquo;Know you on what
      errand you rode to London?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;To betray your father into the
      hands of his enemies; to deliver him up to the hangman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth's eyes grew wide; his mouth fell open, and a frown of perplexity
      drew his brows together. Dully, uncomprehendingly he met Sir Crispin's sad
      gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; he gasped at last. &ldquo;'Sdeath, sir, what is it you mean? My
      father has been dead these ten years. I scarce remember him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin's lips moved, but no word did he utter. Then with a sudden gesture
      of despair he turned to Hogan, who stood apart, a silent witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, Hogan,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;How shall I tell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In answer to the appeal, the Irishman turned to Kenneth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been in error, sir, touching your parentage,&rdquo; quoth he bluntly.
      &ldquo;Alan Stewart, of Bailienochy, was not your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth looked from one to the other of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sirs, is this a jest?&rdquo; he cried, reddening. Then, remarking at length the
      solemnity of their countenances, he stopped short. Crispin came close up
      to him, and placed a hand upon his shoulder. The boy shrank visibly
      beneath the touch, and again an expression of pain crossed the poor
      ruffler's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recall, Kenneth,&rdquo; he said slowly, almost sorrowfully, &ldquo;the story
      that I told you that night in Worcester, when we sat waiting for dawn and
      the hangman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lad nodded vacantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the details? Do you remember I told you how, when I
      swooned beneath the stroke of Joseph Ashburn's sword, the last words I
      heard were those in which he bade his brother slit the throat of the babe
      in the cradle? You were, yourself, present yesternight at Castle Marleigh
      when Joseph Ashburn told me Gregory had been mercifully inclined; that my
      child had not died; that if I gave him his life he would restore him to
      me. You remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Kenneth nodded. A vague, numbing fear was creeping round his heart,
      and his blood seemed chilled by it and stagnant. With fascinated eyes he
      watched the knight's face&mdash;drawn and haggard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a trap that Joseph Ashburn set for me. Yet he did not altogether
      lie. The child Gregory had indeed spared, and it seems from what I have
      learned within the last half-hour that he had entrusted his rearing to
      Alan Stewart, of Bailienochy, seeking afterwards&mdash;I take it&mdash;to
      wed him to his daughter, so that should the King come to his own again,
      they should have the protection of a Marleigh who had served his King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; the lad almost whispered, and his accents were unmistakably of
      horror, &ldquo;you mean that I am your&mdash;Oh, God, I'll not believe it!&rdquo; he
      cried out, with such sudden loathing and passion that Crispin recoiled as
      though he had been struck. A dull flush crept into his cheeks to fade upon
      the instant and give place to a pallor, if possible, intenser than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not believe it! I'll not believe it!&rdquo; the boy repeated, as if
      seeking by that reiteration to shut out a conviction by which he was
      beset. &ldquo;I'll not believe it!&rdquo; he cried again; and now his voice had lost
      its passionate vehemence, and was sunk almost to a moan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it hard to believe myself,&rdquo; was Crispin's answer, and his voice
      was not free from bitterness. &ldquo;But I have a proof here that seems
      incontestable, even had I not the proof of your face to which I have been
      blind these months. Blind with the eyes of my body, at least. The eyes of
      my soul saw and recognized you when first they fell on you in Perth. The
      voice of the blood ordered me then to your side, and though I heard its
      call, I understood not what it meant. Read this letter, boy&mdash;the
      letter that you were to have carried to Colonel Pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his eyes still fixed in a gaze of stupefaction upon Galliard's face,
      Kenneth took the paper. Then slowly, involuntarily almost it seemed, he
      dropped his glance to it, and read. He was long in reading, as though the
      writing presented difficulties, and his two companions watched him the
      while, and waited. At last he turned the paper over, and examined seal and
      superscription as if suspicious that he held a forgery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in some subtle, mysterious way&mdash;that voice of the blood perchance
      to which Crispin had alluded&mdash;he felt conviction stealing down upon
      his soul. Mechanically he moved across to the table, and sat down. Without
      a word, and still holding the crumpled letter in his clenched hand, he set
      his elbows on the table, and, pressing his temples to his palms, he sat
      there dumb. Within him a very volcano raged, and its fires were fed with
      loathing&mdash;loathing for this man whom he had ever hated, yet never as
      he hated him now, knowing him to be his father. It seemed as if to all the
      wrongs which Crispin had done him during the months of their
      acquaintanceship he had now added a fresh and culminating wrong by
      discovering this parentage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat and thought, and his soul grew sick. He probed for some flaw,
      sought for some mistake that might have been made. And yet the more he
      thought, the more he dwelt upon his youth in Scotland, the more convinced
      was he that Crispin had told him the truth. Pre-eminent argument of
      conviction to him was the desire of the Ashburns that he should marry
      Cynthia. Oft he had marvelled that they, wealthy, and even powerful,
      selfish and ambitious, should have selected him, the scion of an obscure
      and impoverished Scottish house, as a bridegroom for their daughter. The
      news now before him made their motives clear; indeed, no other motive
      could exist, no other explanation could there be. He was the heir of
      Castle Marleigh, and the usurpers sought to provide against the day when
      another revolution might oust them and restore the rightful owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some elation his shallow nature felt at realizing this, but that elation
      was short-lived, and dashed by the thought that this ruler, this
      debauchee, this drunken, swearing, roaring tavern knight was his father;
      dashed by the knowledge that meanwhile the Parliament was master, and that
      whilst matters stood so, the Ashburns could defy&mdash;could even destroy
      him, did they learn how much he knew; dashed by the memory that Cynthia,
      whom in his selfish way&mdash;out of his love for himself&mdash;he loved,
      was lost to him for all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here, swinging in a circle, his thoughts reverted to the cause of this&mdash;Crispin
      Galliard, the man who had betrayed him into yesternight's foul business
      and destroyed his every chance of happiness; the man whom he hated, and
      whom, had he possessed the courage as he was possessed by the desire, he
      had risen up and slain; the man that now announced himself his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thinking thus, he sat on in silent, resentful vexation. He started to
      feel a hand upon his shoulder, and to hear the voice of Galliard evidently
      addressing him, yet using a name that was new to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jocelyn, my boy,&rdquo; the voice trembled. &ldquo;You have thought, and you have
      realized&mdash;is it not so? I too thought, and thought brought me
      conviction that what that paper tells is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaguely then the boy remembered that Jocelyn was the name the letter gave
      him. He rose abruptly, and brushed the caressing hand from his shoulder.
      His voice was hard&mdash;possibly the knowledge that he had gained told
      him that he had nothing to fear from this man, and in that assurance his
      craven soul grew brave and bold and arrogant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have realized naught beyond the fact that I owe you nothing but
      unhappiness and ruin. By a trick, by a low fraud, you enlisted me into a
      service that has proved my undoing. Once a cheat always a cheat. What
      credit in the face of that can I give this paper?&rdquo; he cried, talking
      wildly. &ldquo;To me it is incredible, nor do I wish to credit it, for though it
      were true, what then? What then?&rdquo; he repeated, raising his voice into
      accents of defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grief and amazement were blended in Galliard's glance, and also, maybe,
      some reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogan, standing squarely upon the hearth, was beset by the desire to kick
      Master Kenneth, or Master Jocelyn, into the street. His lip curled into a
      sneer of ineffable contempt, for his shrewd eyes read to the bottom of the
      lad's mean soul and saw there clearly writ the confidence that emboldened
      him to voice that insult to the man he must know for his father. Standing
      there, he compared the two, marvelling deeply how they came to be father
      and son. A likeness he saw now between them, yet a likeness that seemed
      but to mark the difference. The one harsh, resolute, and manly, for all
      his reckless living and his misfortunes; the other mild, effeminate,
      hypocritical and shifty. He read it not on their countenances alone, but
      in every line of their figures as they stood, and in his heart he cursed
      himself for having been the instrument to disclose the relationship in
      which they stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth's insolent question was followed by a spell of silence. Crispin
      could not believe that he had heard aright. At last he stretched out his
      hands in a gesture of supplication&mdash;he who throughout his
      thirty-eight years of life, and despite the misfortunes that had been his,
      had never yet stooped to plead from any man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jocelyn,&rdquo; he cried, and the pain in his voice must have melted a heart of
      steel, &ldquo;you are hard. Have you forgotten the story of my miserable life,
      the story that I told you in Worcester? Can you not understand how
      suffering may destroy all that is lofty in a man; how the forgetfulness of
      the winecup may come to be his only consolation; the hope of vengeance his
      only motive for living on, withholding him from self-destruction? Can you
      not picture such a life, and can you not pity and forgive much of the
      wreck that it may make of a man once virtuous and honourable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pleadingly he looked into the lad's face. It remained cold and unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he continued brokenly, &ldquo;that I am not such a man as any
      lad might welcome for a father. But you who know what my life has been,
      Jocelyn, you can surely find it in your heart to pity. I had naught that
      was good or wholesome to live for, Jocelyn; naught to curb the evil moods
      that sent me along evil ways to seek forgetfulness and reparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But from to-night, Jocelyn, my life in you must find a new interest, a
      new motive. I will abandon my old ways. For your sake, Jocelyn, I will
      seek again to become what I was, and you shall have no cause to blush for
      your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still the lad stood silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jocelyn! My God, do I talk in vain?&rdquo; cried the wretched man. &ldquo;Have you no
      heart, no pity, boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last the youth spoke. He was not moved. The agony of this strong man,
      the broken pleading of one whom he had ever known arrogant and strong had
      no power to touch his mean, selfish mind, consumed as it was by the
      contemplation of his undoing&mdash;magnified a hundredfold&mdash;which
      this man had wrought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have ruined my life,&rdquo; was all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will rebuild it, Jocelyn,&rdquo; cried Galliard eagerly. &ldquo;I have friends in
      France&mdash;friends high in power who lack neither the means nor the will
      to aid me. You are a soldier, Jocelyn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much a soldier as I'm a saint,&rdquo; sneered Hogan to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Together we will find service in the armies of Louis,&rdquo; Crispin pursued.
      &ldquo;I promise it. Service wherein you shall gain honour and renown. There we
      will abide until this England shakes herself out of her rebellious
      nightmare. Then, when the King shall come to his own, Castle Marleigh will
      be ours again. Trust in me, Jocelyn.&rdquo; Again his arms went out appealingly:
      &ldquo;Jocelyn my son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the boy made no move to take the outstretched hands, gave no sign of
      relenting. His mind nurtured its resentment&mdash;cherished it indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Cynthia?&rdquo; he asked coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crispin's hands fell to his sides; they grew clenched, and his eyes
      lighted of a sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Jocelyn. I had forgotten! I understand you now. Yes, I dealt
      sorely with you there, and you are right to be resentful. What, after all,
      am I to you what can I be to you compared with her whose image fills your
      soul? What is aught in the world to a man, compared with the woman on whom
      his heart is set? Do I not know it? Have I not suffered for it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mark me, Jocelyn&rdquo;&mdash;and he straightened himself suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;even
      in this, that which I have done I will undo. As I have robbed you of your
      mistress, so will I win her back for you. I swear it. And when that is
      done, when thus every harm I have caused you is repaired, then, Jocelyn,
      perhaps you will come to look with less repugnance upon your father, and
      to feel less resentment towards him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promise much, sir,&rdquo; quoth the boy, with an illrepressed sneer. &ldquo;How
      will you accomplish it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan grunted audibly. Crispin drew himself up, erect, lithe and supple&mdash;a
      figure to inspire confidence in the most despairing. He placed a hand,
      nervous, and strong as steel, upon the boy's shoulder, and the clutch of
      his fingers made Jocelyn wince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Low though your father be fallen,&rdquo; said he sternly, &ldquo;he has never yet
      broken his word. I have pledged you mine, and to-morrow I shall set out to
      perform what I have promised. I shall see you ere I start. You will sleep
      here, will you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jocelyn shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It signifies little where I lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin smiled sadly, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no faith in me yet. But I shall earn it, or&rdquo;&mdash;and his voice
      fell suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;or rid you of a loathsome parent. Hogan, can you find
      him quarters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan replied that there was the room he had already been confined in, and
      that he could lie in it. And deeming that there was nothing to be gained
      by waiting, he thereupon led the youth from the room and down the passage.
      At the foot of the stairs the Irishman paused in the act of descending,
      and raised the taper aloft so that its light might fall full upon the face
      of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were I your father,&rdquo; said he grimly, &ldquo;I would kick you from one end of
      Waltham to the other by way of teaching you filial piety! And were you not
      his son, I would this night read you a lesson you'd never live to
      practise. I would set you to sleep a last long sleep in the kennels of
      Waltham streets. But since you are&mdash;marvellous though it seem&mdash;his
      offspring, and since I love him and may not therefore hurt you, I must
      rest content with telling you that you are the vilest thing that breathes.
      You despise him for a roysterer, for a man of loose ways. Let me, who have
      seen something of men, and who read you to-night to the very dregs of your
      contemptible soul, tell you that compared with you he is a very god. Come,
      you white-livered cur!&rdquo; he ended abruptly. &ldquo;I will light you to your
      chamber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When presently Hogan returned to Crispin he found the Tavern Knight&mdash;that
      man of iron in whom none had ever seen a trace of fear or weakness seated
      with his arms before him on the table, and his face buried in them,
      sobbing like a poor, weak woman.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. SIR CRISPIN'S UNDERTAKING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Through the long October night Crispin and Hogan sat on, and neither
      sought his bed. Crispin's quick wits his burst of grief once over&mdash;had
      been swift to fasten on a plan to accomplish that which he had undertaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      One difficulty confronted him, and until he had mentioned it to Hogan
      seemed unsurmountable he had need of a ship. But in this the Irishman
      could assist him. He knew of a vessel then at Greenwich, whose master was
      in his debt, which should suit the purpose. Money, however, would be
      needed. But when Crispin announced that he was master of some two hundred
      Caroluses, Hogan, with a wave of the hand, declared the matter settled.
      Less than half that sum would hire the man he knew of. That determined,
      Crispin unfolded his project to Hogan, who laughed at the simplicity of
      it, for all that inwardly he cursed the risk Sir Crispin must run for the
      sake of one so unworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the maid loves him, the thing is as good as done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The maid does not love him; leastways, I fear not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan was not surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then it will be difficult, well-nigh impossible.&rdquo; And the Irishman
      became grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Crispin laughed unpleasantly. Years and misfortune had made him
      cynical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the love of a maid?&rdquo; quoth he derisively. &ldquo;A caprice, a fancy, a
      thing that may be guided, overcome or compelled as the occasion shall
      demand. Opportunity is love's parent, Hogan, and given that, any maid may
      love any man. Cynthia shall love my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if she prove rebellious? If she say nay to your proposals? There are
      such women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How then? Am I not the stronger? In such a case it shall be mine to
      compel her, and as I find her, so shall I carry her away. It will be none
      so poor a vengeance on the Ashburns after all.&rdquo; His brow grew clouded.
      &ldquo;But not what I had dreamed of; what I should have taken had he not
      cheated me. To forgo it now&mdash;after all these years of waiting&mdash;is
      another sacrifice I make to Jocelyn. To serve him in this matter I must
      proceed cautiously. Cynthia may fret and fume and stamp, but willy-nilly I
      shall carry her away. Once she is in France, friendless, alone, I make no
      doubt that she will see the convenience of loving Jocelyn&mdash;leastways
      of wedding him and thus shall I have more than repaired the injuries I
      have done him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Irishman's broad face was very grave; his reckless merry eye fixed
      Galliard with a look of sorrow, and this grey-haired, sinning soldier of
      fortune, who had never known a conscience, muttered softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a nice thing you contemplate, Cris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Despite himself, Galliard winced, and his glance fell before Hogan's. For
      a moment he saw the business in its true light, and he wavered in his
      purpose. Then, with a short bark of laughter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gadso, you are sentimental, Harry!&rdquo; said he, to add, more gravely: &ldquo;There
      is my son, and in this lies the only way to his heart.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogan stretched a hand across the table, and set it upon Crispin's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he worth such a stain upon your honour, Crispin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not late in the day, Hogan, for you and me to prate of honour?&rdquo;
       asked Crispin bitterly, yet with averted gaze. &ldquo;God knows my honour is as
      like honour as a beggar's rags are like unto a cloak of ermine. What
      signifies another splash, another rent in that which is tattered beyond
      all semblance of its original condition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you,&rdquo; the Irishman persisted, &ldquo;whether your son was worth the
      sacrifice that the vile deed you contemplate entails?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin shook his arm from the other's grip, and rose abruptly. He crossed
      to the window, and drew back the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Day is breaking,&rdquo; said he gruffly. Then turning, and facing Hogan across
      the room, &ldquo;I have pledged my word to Jocelyn,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The way I have
      chosen is the only one, and I shall follow it. But if your conscience
      cries out against it, Hogan, I give you back your promise of assistance,
      and I shall shift alone. I have done so all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan shrugged his massive shoulders, and reached out for the bottle of
      strong waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are resolved, there is an end to it. My conscience shall not
      trouble me, and upon what aid I have promised and what more I can give,
      you may depend. I drink to the success of your undertaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter they discussed the matter of the vessel that Crispin would
      require, and it was arranged between them that Hogan should send a message
      to the skipper, bidding him come to Harwich, and there await and place
      himself at the command of Sir Crispin Galliard. For fifty pounds Hogan
      thought that he would undertake to land Sir Crispin in France. The
      messenger might be dispatched forthwith, and the Lady Jane should be at
      Harwich, two days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time they had determined upon this, the inmates of the hostelry
      were astir, and from the innyard came to them the noise of bustle and
      preparation for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they left the chamber where they had sat so long, and at the
      yard pump the Tavern Knight performed a rude morning toilet. Thereafter,
      on a simple fare of herrings and brown ale, they broke their fast; and ere
      that meal was done, Kenneth, pale and worn, with dark circles round his
      eyes, entered the common room, and sat moodily apart. But when later Hogan
      went to see to the dispatching of his messenger, Crispin rose and
      approached the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenneth watched him furtively, without pausing in his meal. He had spent a
      very miserable night pondering over the future, which looked gloomy
      enough, and debating whether&mdash;forgetting and ignoring what had passed&mdash;he
      should return to the genteel poverty of his Scottish home, or accept the
      proffered service of this man who announced himself&mdash;and whom he now
      believed&mdash;to be his father. He had thought, but he was far from
      having chosen between Scotland and France, when Crispin now greeted him,
      not without constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jocelyn,&rdquo; he said, speaking slowly, almost humbly. &ldquo;In an hour's time I
      shall set out to return to Marleigh to fulfil my last night's promise to
      you. How I shall accomplish it I scarce know as yet; but accomplish it I
      shall. I have arranged to have a vessel awaiting me, and within three days&mdash;or
      four at the most&mdash;I look to cross to France, bearing your bride with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused for some reply, but none came. The boy sat on with an impassive
      face, his eyes glued to the table, but his mind busy enough upon that
      which his father was pouring into his ear. Presently Crispin continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot refuse to do as I suggest, Jocelyn. I shall make you the
      fullest amends for the harm that I have done you, if you but obey my
      directions. You must quit this place as soon as possible, and proceed on
      your way to London. There you must find a boat to carry you to France, and
      you will await me at the Auberge du Soleil at Calais. You are agreed,
      Jocelyn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight pause, and Jocelyn took his resolution. Yet there was
      still a sullen look in the eyes he lifted to his father's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have little choice, sir,&rdquo; he made answer, &ldquo;and so I must agree. If you
      accomplish what you promise, I own that you will have made amends, and I
      shall crave your pardon for my yesternight's want of faith. I shall await
      you at Calais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin sighed, and for a second his face hardened. It was not the answer
      to which he held himself entitled, and for a moment it rose to the lips of
      this man of fierce and sudden moods to draw back and let the son, whom at
      the moment he began to detest, go his own way, which assuredly would lead
      him to perdition. But a second's thought sufficed to quell that mood of
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not fail you,&rdquo; he said coldly. &ldquo;Have you money for the journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy flushed as he remembered that little was left of what Joseph
      Ashburn had given him. Crispin saw the flush, and reading aright its
      meaning, he drew from his pocket a purse that he had been fingering, and
      placed it quietly upon the table. &ldquo;There are fifty Caroluses in that bag.
      That should suffice to carry you to France. Fare you well until we meet at
      Calais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without giving the boy time to utter thanks that might be unwilling,
      he quickly left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the hour he was in the saddle, and his horse's head was turned
      northwards once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode through Newport some three hours later without drawing rein. By
      the door of the Raven Inn stood a travelling carriage, upon which he did
      not so much as bestow a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the merest thread hangs at times the whole of a man's future life, the
      destinies even of men as yet unborn. So much may depend indeed upon a
      glance, that had not Crispin kept his eyes that morning upon the grey road
      before him, had he chanced to look sideways as he passed the Raven Inn at
      Newport, and seen the Ashburn arms displayed upon the panels of that
      coach, he would of a certainty have paused. And had he done so, his whole
      destiny would assuredly have shaped a different course from that which he
      was unconsciously steering.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. GREGORY'S ATTRITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Joseph's journey to London was occasioned by his very natural anxiety to
      assure himself that Crispin was caught in the toils of the net he had so
      cunningly baited for him, and that at Castle Marleigh he would trouble
      them no more. To this end he quitted Sheringham on the day after Crispin's
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a little perplexed was Cynthia at the topsy-turvydom in which that
      morning she had found her father's house. Kenneth was gone; he had left in
      the dead of night, and seemingly in haste and suddenness, since on the
      previous evening there had been no talk of his departing. Her father was
      abed with a wound that made him feverish. Their grooms were all sick, and
      wandered in a dazed and witless fashion about the castle, their faces
      deadly pale and their eyes lustreless. In the hall she had found a chaotic
      disorder upon descending, and one of the panels of the wainscot she saw
      was freshly cracked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the idea forced itself upon her mind that there had been brawling
      the night before, yet was she far from surmising the motives that could
      have led to it. The conclusion she came to in the end was that the men had
      drunk deep, that in their cups they had waxed quarrelsome, and that swords
      had been drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Joseph then she sought enlightenment, and Joseph lied right handsomely,
      like the ready-witted knave he was. A wondrously plausible story had he
      for her ear; a story that played cunningly upon her knowledge of the
      compact that existed between Kenneth and Sir Crispin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may not know,&rdquo; said he&mdash;full well aware that she did know&mdash;&ldquo;that
      when Galliard saved Kenneth's life at Worcester he exacted from the lad
      the promise that in return Kenneth should aid him in some vengeful
      business he had on hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia nodded that she understood or that she knew, and glibly Joseph
      pursued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night, when on the point of departing, Crispin, who had drunk
      over-freely, as is his custom, reminded Kenneth of his plighted word, and
      demanded of the boy that he should upon the instant go forth with him.
      Kenneth replied that the hour was overlate to be setting out upon a
      journey, and he requested Galliard to wait until to-day, when he would be
      ready to fulfil what he had promised. But Crispin retorted that Kenneth
      was bound by his oath to go with him when he should require it, and again
      he bade the boy make ready at once. Words ensued between them, the boy
      insisting upon waiting until to-day, and Crispin insisting upon his
      getting his boots and cloak and coming with him there and then. More
      heated grew the argument, till in the end Galliard, being put out of
      temper, snatched at his sword, and would assuredly have spitted the boy
      had not your father interposed, thereby getting himself wounded.
      Thereafter, in his drunken lust Sir Crispin went the length of wantonly
      cracking that panel with his sword by way of showing Kenneth what he had
      to expect unless he obeyed him. At that I intervened, and using my
      influence, I prevailed upon Kenneth to go with Galliard as he demanded. To
      this, for all his reluctance, Kenneth ended by consenting, and so they are
      gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By that most glib and specious explanation Cynthia was convinced. True,
      she added a question touching the amazing condition of the grooms, in
      reply to which Joseph afforded her a part of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Crispin sent them some wine, and they drank to his departure so
      heartily that they are not rightly sober yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied with this explanation Cynthia repaired to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Gregory had not agreed with Joseph what narrative they were to offer
      Cynthia, for it had never crossed his dull mind that the disorder of the
      hall and the absence of Kenneth might cause her astonishment. And so when
      she touched upon the matter of his wound, like the blundering fool he was,
      he must needs let his tongue wag upon a tale which, if no less imaginative
      than Joseph's, was vastly its inferior in plausibility and had yet the
      quality of differing from it totally in substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plague on that dog, your lover, Cynthia,&rdquo; he growled from the mountain of
      pillows that propped him. &ldquo;If he should come to wed my daughter after
      pinning me to the wainscot of my own hall may I be for ever damned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; quoth she. &ldquo;Do you say that Kenneth did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, did he. He ran at me ere I could draw, like the coward he is, sink
      him, and had me through the shoulder in the twinkling of an eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was something beyond her understanding. What were they concealing
      from her? She set her wits to the discovery and plied her father with
      another question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came you to quarrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? 'Twas&mdash;'twas concerning you, child,&rdquo; replied Gregory at random,
      and unable to think of a likelier motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, concerning me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me, Cynthia,&rdquo; he groaned in despair. &ldquo;Go, child. I am grievously
      wounded. I have the fever, girl. Go; let me sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, father, what passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unnatural child,&rdquo; whined Gregory feebly, &ldquo;will you plague a sick man with
      questions? Would you keep him from the sleep that may mean recovery to
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, dear,&rdquo; she murmured softly, &ldquo;if I thought it was as you say, I
      would leave you. But you know that you are but attempting to conceal
      something from me something that I should know, that I must know. Bethink
      you that it is of my lover that you have spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By a stupendous effort Gregory shaped a story that to him seemed likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, since know you must,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;this is what befell: we
      had all drunk over-deep to our shame do I confess it&mdash;and growing
      tenderhearted for you, and bethinking me of your professed distaste to
      Kenneth's suit, I told him that for all the results that were likely to
      attend his sojourn at Castle Marleigh, he might as well bear Crispin
      company in his departure. He flared up at that, and demanded of me that I
      should read him my riddle. Faith, I did by telling him that we were like
      to have snow on midsummer's day ere he 'became your husband. That speech
      of mine so angered him, being as he was all addled with wine and ripe for
      any madness, that he sprang up and drew on me there and then. The others
      sought to get between us, but he was over-quick, and before I could do
      more than rise from the table his sword was through my shoulder and into
      the wainscot at my back. After that it was clear he could not remain here,
      and I demanded that he should leave upon the instant. Himself he was
      nothing loath, for he realized his folly, and he misliked the gleam of
      Joseph's eye&mdash;which can be wondrous wicked upon occasion. Indeed, but
      for my intercession Joseph had laid him stark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That both her uncle and her father had lied to her&mdash;the one
      cunningly, the other stupidly&mdash;she had never a doubt, and vaguely
      uneasy was Cynthia to learn the truth. Later that day the castle was busy
      with the bustle of Joseph's departure, and this again was a matter that
      puzzled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither do you journey, uncle?&rdquo; she asked of him as he was in the act of
      stepping out to enter the waiting carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To London, sweet cousin,&rdquo; was his brisk reply. &ldquo;I am, it seems, becoming
      a very vagrant in my old age. Have you commands for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you look to do in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, child, let that be for the present. I will tell you perhaps when I
      return. The door, Stephen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She watched his departure with uneasy eyes and uneasy heart. A fear
      pervaded her that in all that had befallen, in all that was befalling
      still&mdash;what ever it might be&mdash;some evil was at work, and an evil
      that had Crispin for its scope. She had neither reason nor evidence from
      which to draw this inference. It was no more than the instinct whose voice
      cries out to us at times a presage of ill, and oftentimes compels our
      attention in a degree far higher than any evidence could command.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fear that was in her urged her to seek what information she could on
      every hand, but without success. From none could she cull the merest scrap
      of evidence to assist her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the morrow she had information as prodigal as it was unlooked-for,
      and from the unlikeliest of sources&mdash;her father himself. Chafing at
      his inaction and lured into indiscretions by the subsiding of the pain of
      his wound, Gregory quitted his bed and came below that night to sup with
      his daughter. As his wont had been for years, he drank freely. That done,
      alive to the voice of his conscience, and seeking to drown its
      loud-tongued cry, he drank more freely still, so that in the end his
      henchman, Stephen, was forced to carry him to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Stephen had grown grey in the service of the Ashburns, and amongst
      much valuable knowledge that he had amassed, was a skill in dealing with
      wounds and a wide understanding of the ways to go about healing them. This
      knowledge made him realize how unwise at such a season was Gregory's
      debauch, and sorrowfully did he wag his head over his master's condition
      of stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen had grave fears concerning him, and these fears were realized when
      upon the morrow Gregory awoke on fire with the fever. They summoned a
      leech from Sheringham, and this cunning knave, with a view to adding
      importance to the cure he was come to effect, and which in reality
      presented no alarming difficulty, shook his head with ominous gravity, and
      whilst promising to do &ldquo;all that his skill permitted,&rdquo; he spoke of a
      clergyman to help Gregory make his peace with God. For the leech had no
      cause to suspect that the whole of the Sacred College might have found the
      task beyond its powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wild fear took Gregory in its grip. How could he die with such a load as
      that which he now carried upon his soul? And the leech, seeing how the
      matter preyed upon his patient's mind, made shift&mdash;but too late&mdash;to
      tranquillize him with assurances that he was not really like to die, and
      that he had but mentioned a parson so that Gregory in any case should be
      prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm once raised, however, was not so easily to be allayed, and the
      conviction remained with Gregory that his sands were well-nigh run, and
      that the end could be but a matter of days in coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Realizing as he did how richly he had earned damnation, a frantic terror
      was upon him, and all that day he tossed and turned, now blaspheming, now
      praying, now weeping. His life had been indeed one protracted course of
      wrong-doing, and many had suffered by Gregory's evil ways&mdash;many a man
      and many a woman. But as the stars pale and fade when the sun mounts the
      sky, so too were the lesser wrongs that marked his earthly pilgrimage of
      sin rendered pale or blotted into insignificance by the greater wrong he
      had done Ronald Marleigh&mdash;a wrong which was not ended yet, but whose
      completion Joseph was even then working to effect. If only he could save
      Crispin even now in the eleventh hour; if by some means he could warn him
      not to repair to the sign of the Anchor in Thames Street. His disordered
      mind took no account of the fact that in the time that was sped since
      Galliard's departure, the knight should already have reached London.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it came about that, consumed at once by the desire to make
      confession to whomsoever it might be, and the wish to attempt yet to avert
      the crowning evil of whose planning he was partly guilty inasmuch as he
      had tacitly consented to Joseph's schemes, Gregory called for his
      daughter. She came readily enough, hoping for exactly that which was about
      to take place, yet fearing sorely that her hopes would suffer frustration,
      and that she would learn nothing from her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; he cried, in mingled dread and sorrow, &ldquo;Cynthia, my child, I am
      about to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew both from Stephen and from the leech that this was far from being
      his condition. Nevertheless her filial piety was at that moment a touching
      sight. She smoothed his pillows with a gentle grace that was in itself a
      soothing caress, even as her soft sympathetic voice was a caress. She took
      his hand, and spoke to him endearingly, seeking to relieve the sombre mood
      whose prey he was become, assuring him that the leech had told her his
      danger was none so imminent, and that with quiet and a little care he
      would be up and about again ere many days were sped. But Gregory rejected
      hopelessly all efforts at consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am on my death-bed, Cynthia,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;and when I am gone I know
      not whom there may be to cheer and comfort your lot in life. Your lover is
      away on an errand of Joseph's, and it may well betide that he will never
      again cross the threshold of Castle Marleigh. Unnatural though I may seem,
      sweetheart, my dying wish is that this may be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, if that be all that grieves you, I can reassure you. I do not
      love Kenneth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You apprehend me amiss,&rdquo; said he tartly. &ldquo;Do you recall the story of Sir
      Crispin Galliard's life that you had from Kenneth on the night of Joseph's
      return?&rdquo; His voice shook as he put the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. I am not like to forget it, and nightly do I pray,&rdquo; she went
      on, her tongue outrunning discretion and betraying her feelings for
      Galliard, &ldquo;that God may punish those murderers who wrecked his existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, girl,&rdquo; he whispered in a quavering voice. &ldquo;You know not what you
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do; and as there is a just God my prayer shall be answered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; he wailed. His eyes were wild, and the hand that rested in hers
      trembled violently. &ldquo;Do you know that it is against your father and your
      father's brother that you invoke God's vengeance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been kneeling at his bedside; but now, when he pronounced those
      words, she rose slowly and stood silent for a spell, her eyes seeking his
      with an awful look that he dared not meet. At last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you rave,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;it is the fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, child, my mind is clear, and what I have said is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True?&rdquo; she echoed, no louder than a whisper, and her eyes grew round with
      horror. &ldquo;True that you and my uncle are the butchers who slew their
      cousin, this man's wife, and sought to murder him as well&mdash;leaving
      him for dead? True that you are the thieves who claiming kinship by virtue
      of that very marriage have usurped his estates and this his castle during
      all these years, whilst he himself went an outcast, homeless and
      destitute? Is that what you ask me to believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; he assented, with a feeble sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was pale&mdash;white to the very lips, and her blue eyes
      smouldered behind the shelter of her drooping lids. She put her hand to
      her breast, then to her brow, pushing back the brown hair by a mechanical
      gesture that was pathetic in the tale of pain it told. For support she was
      leaning now against the wall by the head of his couch. In silence she
      stood so while you might count to twenty; then with a sudden vehemence
      revealing the passion of anger and grief that swayed her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;why in God's name do you tell me this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; His utterance was thick, and his eyes, that were grown dull as a
      snake's, stared straight before him, daring not to meet his daughter's
      glance. &ldquo;I tell it you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because I am a dying man.&rdquo; And he hoped
      that the consideration of that momentous fact might melt her, and might by
      pity win her back to him&mdash;that she was lost to him he realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you because I am a dying man,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I tell it you because
      in such an hour I fain would make confession and repent, that God may have
      mercy upon my soul. I tell it you, too, because the tragedy begun eighteen
      years ago is not yet played out, and it may yet be mine to avert the end
      we had prepared&mdash;Joseph and I. Thus perhaps a merciful God will place
      it in my power to make some reparation. Listen, child. It was against us,
      as you will have guessed, that Galliard enlisted Kenneth's services, and
      here on the night of Joseph's return he called upon the boy to fulfil him
      what he had sworn. The lad had no choice but to obey; indeed, I forced him
      to it by attacking him and compelling him to draw, which is how I came by
      this wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crispin had of a certainty killed Joseph but that your uncle bethought
      him of telling him that his son lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He saved his life by a lie! That was worthy of him,&rdquo; said Cynthia
      scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, child, he spoke the truth, and when Joseph offered to restore the
      boy to him, he had every intention of so doing. But in the moment of
      writing the superscription to the letter Crispin was to bear to those that
      had reared the child, Joseph bethought him of a foul scheme for Galliard's
      final destruction. And so he has sent him to London instead, to a house in
      Thames Street, where dwells one Colonel Pride, who bears Sir Crispin a
      heavy grudge, and into whose hands he will be thus delivered. Can aught be
      done, Cynthia, to arrest this&mdash;to save Sir Crispin from Joseph's
      snare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well might you seek to restore the breath to a dead man,&rdquo; she
      answered, and her voice was so oddly calm, so cold and bare of expression,
      that Gregory shuddered to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not delude yourself,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Sir Crispin will have reached London
      long ere this, and by now Joseph will be well on his way to see that there
      is no mistake made, and that the life you ruined hopelessly years ago is
      plucked at last from this unfortunate man. Merciful God! am I truly your
      daughter?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Is my name indeed Ashburn, and have I been reared
      upon the estates that by crime you gained possession of? Estates that by
      crime you hold&mdash;for they are his; every stone, every stick that goes
      to make the place belongs to him, and now he has gone to his death by your
      contriving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moan escaped her, and she covered her face with her hands. A moment she
      stood rocking there&mdash;a fair, lissom plant swept by a gale of
      ineffable emotion. Then the breath seemed to go all out of her in one
      great sigh, and Gregory, who dared not look her way, heard the swish of
      her gown, followed by a thud as she collapsed and lay swooning on the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      So disturbed at that was Gregory's spirit that, forgetting his wound, his
      fever, and the death which he had believed impending, he leapt from his
      couch, and throwing wide the door, bellowed lustily for Stephen. In
      frightened haste came his henchman to answer the petulant summons, and in
      obedience to Gregory's commands he went off again as quickly in quest of
      Catherine&mdash;Cynthia's woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between them they bore the unconscious girl to her chamber, leaving
      Gregory to curse himself for having been lured into a confession that it
      now seemed to him had been unnecessary, since in his newly found vitality
      he realized that death was none so near a thing as that scoundrelly fool
      of a leech had led him to believe.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. THE WOOING OF CYNTHIA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cynthia's swoon was after all but brief. Upon recovering consciousness her
      first act was to dismiss her woman. She had need to be alone&mdash;the
      need of the animal that is wounded to creep into its lair and hide itself.
      And so alone with her sorrow she sat through that long day.
    </p>
    <p>
      That her father's condition was grievous she knew to be untrue, so that
      concerning him there was not even that pity that she might have felt had
      she believed&mdash;as he would have had her believe that he was dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she pondered the monstrous disclosure he had made, her heart hardened
      against him, and even as she had asked him whether indeed she was his
      daughter, so now she vowed to herself that she would be his daughter no
      longer. She would leave Castle Marleigh, never again to set eyes upon her
      father, and she hoped that during the little time she must yet remain
      there&mdash;a day, or two at most&mdash;she might be spared the ordeal of
      again meeting a parent for whom respect was dead, and who inspired her
      with just that feeling of horror she must have for any man who confessed
      himself a murderer and a thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      She resolved to repair to London to a sister of her mother's, where for
      her dead mother's sake she would find a haven extended readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eventide she came at last from her chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had need of air, need of the balm that nature alone can offer in
      solitude to poor wounded human souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a mild and sunny evening, worthy rather of August than of October,
      and aimlessly Mistress Cynthia wandered towards the cliffs overlooking
      Sheringham Hithe. There she sate herself in sad dejection upon the grass,
      and gazed wistfully seaward, her mind straying now from the sorry theme
      that had held dominion in it, to the memories that very spot evoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was there, sitting as she sat now, her eyes upon the shimmering waste
      of sea, and the gulls circling overhead, that she had awakened to the
      knowledge of her love for Crispin. And so to him strayed now her thoughts,
      and to the fate her father had sent him to; and thus back again to her
      father and the evil he had wrought. It is matter for conjecture whether
      her loathing for Gregory would have been as intense as it was, had another
      than Crispin Galliard been his victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her life seemed at an end as she sat that October evening on the cliffs.
      No single interest linked her to existence; nothing, it seemed, was left
      her to hope for till the end should come&mdash;and no doubt it would be
      long in coming, for time moves slowly when we wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wistful she sat and thought, and every thought begat a sigh, and then of a
      sudden&mdash;surely her ears had tricked her, enslaved by her imagination&mdash;a
      crisp, metallic voice rang out close behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are we pensive, Mistress Cynthia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a catch in her breath as she turned her head. Her cheeks took
      fire, and for a second were aflame. Then they went deadly white, and it
      seemed that time and life and the very world had paused in its relentless
      progress towards eternity. For there stood the object of her thoughts and
      sighs, sudden and unexpected, as though the earth had cast him up on to
      her surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thin lips were parted in a smile that softened wondrously the
      harshness of his face, and his eyes seemed then to her alight with
      kindness. A moment's pause there was, during which she sought her voice,
      and when she had found it, all that she could falter was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, how came you here? They told me that you rode to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, so I did. But on the road I chanced to halt, and having halted I
      discovered reason why I should return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had discovered a reason. She asked herself breathlessly what might that
      reason be, and finding herself no answer to the question, she put it next
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew near to her before replying. &ldquo;May I sit with you awhile, Cynthia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved aside to make room for him, as though the broad cliff had been a
      narrow ledge, and with the sigh of a weary man finding a resting-place at
      last, he sank down beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tenderness in his voice that set her pulses stirring wildly.
      Did she guess aright the reason that had caused him to break his journey
      and return? That he had done so&mdash;no matter what the reason&mdash;she
      thanked God from her inmost heart, as for a miracle that had saved him
      from the doom awaiting him in London town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I presumptuous, child, to think that haply the meditation in which I
      found you rapt was for one, unworthy though he be, who went hence but some
      few days since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ambiguous question drove every thought from her mind, filling it to
      overflowing with the supreme good of his presence, and the frantic hope
      that she had read aright the reason of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I conjectured rightly?&rdquo; he asked, since she kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mayhap you have,&rdquo; she whispered in return, and then, marvelling at her
      boldness, blushed. He glanced sharply at her from narrowing eyes. It was
      not the answer he had looked to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a father might have done he took the slender hand that rested upon the
      grass beside him, and she, poor child, mistaking the promptings of that
      action, suffered it to lie in his strong grasp. With averted head she
      gazed upon the sea below, until a mist of tears rose up to blot it out.
      The breeze seemed full of melody and gladness. God was very good to her,
      and sent her in her hour of need this great consolation&mdash;a
      consolation indeed that must have served to efface whatever sorrow could
      have beset her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then, sweet lady, is my task that I had feared to find all fraught
      with difficulty, grown easy indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And hearing him pause:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What task is that, Sir Crispin?&rdquo; she asked, intent on helping him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply at once. He found it difficult to devise an answer. To
      tell her brutally that he was come to bear her away, willing or unwilling,
      on behalf of another, was not easy. Indeed, it was impossible, and he was
      glad that inclinations in her which he had little dreamt of, put the
      necessity aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My task, Mistress Cynthia, is to bear you hence. To ask you to resign
      this peaceful life, this quiet home in a little corner of the world, and
      to go forth to bear life's hardships with one who, whatever be his
      shortcomings, has the all-redeeming virtue of loving you beyond aught else
      in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gazed intently at her as he spoke, and her eyes fell before his glance.
      He noted the warm, red blood suffusing her cheeks, her brow, her very
      neck; and he could have laughed aloud for joy at finding so simple that
      which he had feared would prove so hard. Some pity, too, crept
      unaccountably into his stern heart, fathered by the little faith which in
      his inmost soul he reposed in Jocelyn. And where, had she resisted him, he
      would have grown harsh and violent, her acquiescence struck the weapons
      from his hands, and he caught himself well-nigh warning her against
      accompanying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is much to ask,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But love is selfish, and love asks much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she protested softly, &ldquo;it is not much to ask. Rather is it much
      to offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that he was aghast. Yet he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bethink you, Mistress Cynthia, I have ridden back to Sheringham to ask
      you to come with me into France, where my son awaits us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He forgot for the moment that she was in ignorance of his relationship to
      him he looked upon as her lover, whilst she gave this mention of his son,
      of whose existence she had already heard from her; father, little thought
      at that moment. The hour was too full of other things that touched her
      more nearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you to abandon the ease and peace of Sheringham for a life as a
      soldier's bride that may be rough and precarious for a while, though,
      truth to tell, I have some influence at the Luxembourg, and friends upon
      whose assistance I can safely count, to find your husband honourable
      employment, and set him on the road to more. And how, guided by so sweet a
      saint, can he but mount to fame and honour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke no word, but the hand resting in his entwined his fingers in an
      answering pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare I then ask so much?&rdquo; cried he. And as if the ambiguity which had
      marked his speech were not enough, he must needs, as he put this question,
      bend in his eagerness towards her until her brown tresses touched his
      swart cheek. Was it then strange that the eagerness wherewith he urged
      another's suit should have been by her interpreted as her heart would have
      had it?
    </p>
    <p>
      She set her hands upon his shoulders, and meeting his eager gaze with the
      frank glance of the maid who, out of trust, is fearless in her surrender:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throughout my life I shall thank God that you have dared it,&rdquo; she made
      answer softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange reply he deemed it, yet, pondering, he took her meaning to be
      that since Jocelyn had lacked the courage to woo boldly, she was glad that
      he had sent an ambassador less timid.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause followed, and for a spell they sat silent, he thinking of how to
      frame his next words; she happy and content to sit beside him without
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      She marvelled somewhat at the strangeness of his wooing, which was like
      unto no wooing her romancer's tales had told her of, but then she
      reflected how unlike he was to other men, and therein she saw the
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;that matters were easier; that it might be mine to
      boldly sue your hand from your father, but it may not be. Even had events
      not fallen out as they have done, it had been difficult; as it is, it is
      impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again his meaning was obscure, and when he spoke of suing for her hand
      from her father, he did not think of adding that he would have sued it for
      his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no father,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;This very day have I disowned him.&rdquo; And
      observing the inquiry with which his eyes were of a sudden charged: &ldquo;Would
      you have me own a thief, a murderer, my father?&rdquo; she demanded, with a
      fierceness of defiant shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, then?&rdquo; he ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered sorrowfully, &ldquo;I know all there is to be known. I
      learnt it all this morning. All day have I pondered it in my shame to end
      in the resolve to leave Sheringham. I had intended going to London to my
      mother's sister. You are very opportunely come.&rdquo; She smiled up at him
      through the tears that were glistening in her eyes. &ldquo;You come even as I
      was despairing&mdash;nay, when already I had despaired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Crispin was no longer puzzled by the readiness of her acquiescence.
      Here was the explanation of it. Forced by the honesty of her pure soul to
      abandon the house of a father she knew at last for what he was, the refuge
      Crispin now offered her was very welcome. She had determined before he
      came to quit Castle Marleigh, and timely indeed was his offer of the means
      of escape from a life that was grown impossible. A great pity filled his
      heart. She was selling herself, he thought; accepting the proposal which,
      on his son's behalf, he made, and from which at any other season, he
      feared, she would have shrunk in detestation.
    </p>
    <p>
      That pity was reflected on his countenance now, and noting its solemnity,
      and misconstruing it, she laughed outright, despite herself. He did not
      ask her why she laughed, he did not notice it; his thoughts were busy
      already upon another matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When next he spoke, it was to describe to her the hollow of the road where
      on the night of his departure from the castle he had been flung from his
      horse. She knew the spot, she told him, and there at dusk upon the
      following day she would come to him. Her woman must accompany her, and for
      all that he feared such an addition to the party might retard their
      flight, yet he could not gainsay her resolution. Her uncle, he learnt from
      her, was absent from Sheringham; he had set out four days ago for London.
      For her father she would leave a letter, and in this matter Crispin urged
      her to observe circumspection, giving no indication of the direction of
      her journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all he said, now that matters were arranged he was calm, practical, and
      unloverlike, and for all that she would he had been less self-possessed,
      her faith in him caused her, upon reflection, even to admire this which
      she conceived to be restraint. Yet, when at parting he did no more than
      courteously bend before her, and kiss her hand as any simpering gallant
      might have done, she was all but vexed, and not to be outdone in coldness,
      she grew frigid. But it was lost upon him. He had not a lover's
      discernment, quickened by anxious eyes that watch for each flitting change
      upon his mistress's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted thus, and into the heart of Mistress Cynthia there crept that
      night a doubt that banished sleep. Was she wise in entrusting herself so
      utterly to a man of whom she knew but little, and that learnt from rumours
      which had not been good? But scarcely was it because of that that doubts
      assailed her. Rather was it because of his cool deliberateness which
      argued not the great love wherewith she fain would fancy him inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      For consolation she recalled a line that had it great fires were soon
      burnt out, and she sought to reassure herself that the flame of his love,
      if not all-consuming, would at least burn bright and steadfastly until the
      end of life. And so she fell asleep, betwixt hope and fear, yet no longer
      with any hesitancy touching the morrow's course.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning she took her woman into her confidence, and scared her with
      it out of what little sense the creature owned. Yet to such purpose did
      she talk, that when that evening, as Crispin waited by the coach he had
      taken, in the hollow of the road, he saw approaching him a portly,
      middle-aged dame with a valise. This was Cynthia's woman, and Cynthia
      herself was not long in following, muffled in a long, black cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He greeted her warmly&mdash;affectionately almost yet with none of the
      rapture to which she held herself entitled as some little recompense for
      all that on his behalf she left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Urbanely he handed her into the coach, and, after her, her woman. Then
      seeing that he made shift to close the door:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Do you not ride with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to a saddled horse standing by the roadside, and which she had
      not noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be better so. You will be at more comfort in the carriage without
      me. Moreover, it will travel the lighter and the swifter, and speed will
      prove our best friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door, and stepped back with a word of command to the driver.
      The whip cracked, and Cynthia flung herself back almost in a pet. What
      manner of lover, she asked herself, was thin and what manner of woman she,
      to let herself be borne away by one who made so little use of the arts and
      wiles of sweet persuasion? To carry her off, and yet not so much as sit
      beside her, was worthy only of a man who described such a journey as
      tedious. She marvelled greatly at it, yet more she marvelled at herself
      that she did not abandon this mad undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coach moved on and the flight from Sheringham was begun.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. CYNTHIA'S FLIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the night they went rumbling on their way at a pace whose
      sluggishness elicited many an oath from Crispin as he rode a few yards in
      the rear, ever watchful of the possibility of pursuit. But there was none,
      nor none need he have feared, since whilst he rode through the cold night,
      Gregory Ashburn slept as peacefully as a man may with the fever and an
      evil conscience, and imagined his dutiful daughter safely abed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the first streaks of steely light came a thin rain to heighten
      Crispin's discomfort, for of late he had been overmuch in the saddle, and
      strong though he was, he was yet flesh and blood, and subject to its ills.
      Towards ten o'clock they passed through Denham. When they were clear of it
      Cynthia put her head from the window. She had slept well, and her mood was
      lighter and happier. As Crispin rode a yard or so behind, he caught sight
      of her fresh, smiling face, and it affected him curiously. The tenderness
      that two days ago had been his as he talked to her upon the cliffs was
      again upon him, and the thought that anon she would be linked to him by
      the ties of relationship, was pleasurable. She gave him good morrow
      prettily, and he, spurring his horse to the carriage door, was solicitous
      to know of her comfort. Nor did he again fall behind until Stafford was
      reached at noon. Here, at the sign of the Suffolk Arms, he called a halt,
      and they broke their fast on the best the house could give them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia was gay, and so indeed was Crispin, yet she noted in him that
      coolness which she accounted restraint, and gradually her spirits sank
      again before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Crispin's chagrin there were no horses to be had. Someone in great
      haste had ridden through before them, and taken what relays the hostelry
      could give, leaving four jaded beasts in the stable. It seemed, indeed,
      that they must remain there until the morrow, and in coming to that
      conclusion, Sir Crispin's temper suffered sorely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why need it put you so about,&rdquo; cried Cynthia, in arch reproach, &ldquo;since I
      am with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blood and fire, madam,&rdquo; roared Galliard, &ldquo;it is precisely for that reason
      that I am exercised. What if your father came upon us here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, sir, is abed with a sword-wound and a fever,&rdquo; she replied, and
      he remembered then how Kenneth had spitted Gregory through the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;he will have discovered your flight, and I dare
      swear we shall have his myrmidons upon our heels. Should they come up with
      us we shall hardly find them more gentle than he would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paled at that, and for a second there was silence. Then her hand stole
      forth upon his arm, and she looked at him with tightened lips and a
      defiant air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, indeed, if they do? Are you not with me?&rdquo; A king had praised his
      daring, and for his valour had dubbed him knight upon a field of stricken
      battle; yet the honour of it had not brought him the elation those words&mdash;expressive
      of her utter faith in him and his prowess&mdash;begat in his heart. Upon
      the instant the delay ceased to fret him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;since you put it so, I care not who comes. The Lord
      Protector himself shall not drag you from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the nearest he had gone to a passionate speech since they had left
      Sheringham, and it pleased her; yet in uttering it he had stood a full two
      yards away, and in that she had taken no pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bidding her remain and get what rest she might, he left her, and she,
      following his straight, lank figure&mdash;so eloquent of strength&mdash;and
      the familiar poise of his left hand upon the pummel of his sword, felt
      proud indeed that he belonged to her, and secure in his protection. She
      sat herself at the window when he was gone, and whilst she awaited his
      return, she hummed a gay measure softly to herself. Her eyes were bright,
      and there was a flush upon her cheeks. Not even in the wet, greasy street
      could she find any unsightliness that afternoon. But as she waited, and
      the minutes grew to hours, that flush faded, and the sparkle died
      gradually from her eyes. The measure that she had hummed was silenced, and
      her shapely mouth took on a pout of impatience, which anon grew into a
      tighter mould, as he continued absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A frown drew her brows together, and Mistress Cynthia's thoughts were much
      as they had been the night before she left Castle Marleigh. Where was he?
      Why came he not? She took up a book of plays that lay upon the table, and
      sought to while away the time by reading. The afternoon faded into dusk,
      and still he did not come. Her woman appeared, to ask whether she should
      call for lights and at that Cynthia became almost violent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Sir Crispin?&rdquo; she demanded. And to the dame's quavering answer
      that she knew not, she angrily bade her go ascertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a pet, Cynthia paced the chamber whilst Catherine was gone upon that
      errand. Did this man account her a toy to while away the hours for which
      he could find no more profitable diversion, and to leave her to die of
      ennui when aught else offered? Was it a small thing that he had asked of
      her, to go with him into a strange land, that he should show himself so
      little sensible of the honour done him?
    </p>
    <p>
      With such questions did she plague herself, and finding them either
      unanswerable, or answerable only by affirmatives, she had well-nigh
      resolved upon leaving the inn, and making her way back to London to seek
      out her aunt, when the door opened and her woman reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; cried Cynthia, seeing her alone. &ldquo;Where is Sir Crispin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Below, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Below?&rdquo; echoed she. &ldquo;And what, pray, doth he below?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is at dice with a gentleman from London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the dim light of the October twilight the woman saw not the sudden
      pallor of her mistress's cheeks, but she heard the gasp of pain that was
      almost a cry. In her mortification, Cynthia could have wept had she given
      way to her feelings. The man who had induced her to elope with him sat at
      dice with a gentleman from London! Oh, it was monstrous! At the thought of
      it she broke into a laugh that appalled her tiring-woman; then mastering
      her hysteria, she took a sudden determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me the host,&rdquo; she cried, and the frightened Catherine obeyed her at
      a run.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the landlord came, bearing lights, and bending his aged back
      obsequiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a pillion?&rdquo; she asked abruptly. &ldquo;Well, fool, why do you stare?
      Have you a pillion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a knave to ride with me, and a couple more as escort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might procure them, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within half an hour, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go see to it,&rdquo; she broke in, her foot beating the ground
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madam&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, go, go!&rdquo; she cried, her voice rising at each utterance of that
      imperative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madam,&rdquo; the host persisted despairingly, and speaking quickly so
      that he might get the words out, &ldquo;I have no horses fit to travel ten
      miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need to go but five,&rdquo; she retorted quickly, her only thought being to
      get the beasts, no matter what their condition. &ldquo;Now, go, and come not
      back until all is ready. Use dispatch and I will pay you well, and above
      all, not a word to the gentleman who came hither with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sorely-puzzled host withdrew to do her bidding, won to it by her
      promise of good payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone she sat for half an hour, vainly fostering the hope that ere the
      landlord returned to announce the conclusion of his preparations, Crispin
      might have remembered her and come. But he did not appear, and in her
      solitude this poor little maid was very miserable, and shed some tears
      that had still more of anger than sorrow in their source. At length the
      landlord came. She summoned her woman, and bade her follow by post on the
      morrow. The landlord she rewarded with a ring worth twenty times the value
      of the service, and was led by him through a side door into the innyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she found three horses, one equipped with the pillion on which she
      was to ride behind a burly stableboy. The other two were mounted by a
      couple of stalwart and well-armed men, one of whom carried a
      funnel-mouthed musketoon with a swagger that promised prodigies of valour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrapped in her cloak, she mounted behind the stable-boy, and bade him set
      out and take the road to Denham. Her dream was at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Quinn, the landlord, watched her departure with eyes that were
      charged with doubt and concern. As he made fast the door of the stableyard
      after she had passed out, he ominously shook his hoary head and muttered
      to himself humble, hostelry-flavoured philosophies touching the strange
      ways of men with women, and the stranger ways of women with men. Then,
      taking up his lanthorn, he slowly retraced his steps to the buttery where
      his wife was awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With sleeves rolled high above her pink and deeply-dimpled elbows stood
      Mistress Quinn at work upon the fashioning of a pastry, when her husband
      entered and set down his lanthorn with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be so plagued,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;To be browbeaten by a slip of a wench&mdash;a
      fine gentleman's baggage with the airs and vapours of a lady of quality.
      Am I not a fool to have endured it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly you are a fool,&rdquo; his wife agreed, kneading diligently,
      &ldquo;whatever you may have endured. What now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His fat face was puckered into a thousand wrinkles. His little eyes gazed
      at her with long-suffering malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are my wife,&rdquo; he answered pregnantly, as who would say: Thus is my
      folly clearly proven! and seeing that the assertion was not one that
      admitted of dispute, Mistress Quinn was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, 'tis ill done!&rdquo; he broke out a moment later. &ldquo;Shame on me for it; it
      is ill done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have done it 'tis sure to be ill done, and shame on you in good
      sooth&mdash;but for what?&rdquo; put in his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For sending those poor jaded beasts upon the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What beasts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What beasts? Do I keep turtles? My horses, woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whither have you sent them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Denham with the baggage that came hither this morning in the company
      of that very fierce gentleman who was in such a pet because we had no
      horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; inquired the hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At dice with those other gallants from town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At dice quotha? And she's gone, you say?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Quinn, pausing in
      her labours squarely to face her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stupid!&rdquo; rejoined his docile spouse, vexed by his laconic assent. &ldquo;Do you
      mean she has run away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis what anyone might take from what I have told you,&rdquo; he answered
      sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have lent her horses and helped her to get away, and you leave
      her husband at play in there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen her marriage lines, I make no doubt,&rdquo; he sneered
      irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dolt! If the gentleman horsewhips you, you will have richly earned
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What?&rdquo; gasped he, and his rubicund cheeks lost something of their
      high colour, for here was a possibility that had not entered into his
      calculations. But Mistress Quinn stayed not to answer him. Already she was
      making for the door, wiping the dough from her hands on to her apron as
      she went. A suspicion of her purpose flashed through her husband's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; he inquired nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell the gentleman what has taken place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he cried, resolutely barring her way. &ldquo;Nay. That you shall not.
      Would you&mdash;would you ruin me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a look of contempt, and dodging his grasp she gained the door
      and was half-way down the passage towards the common room before he had
      overtaken her and caught her round the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad, woman?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Will you undo me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you undo me,&rdquo; she bade him, snatching at his hands. But he clutched
      with the tightness of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not go,&rdquo; he swore. &ldquo;Come back and leave the gentleman to make
      the discovery for himself. I dare swear it will not afflict him overmuch.
      He has abandoned her sorely since they came; not a doubt of it but that he
      is weary of her. At least he need not know I lent her horses. Let him
      think she fled a-foot, when he discovers her departure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; she answered stubbornly, dragging him with her a yard or two
      nearer the door. &ldquo;The gentleman shall be warned. Is a woman to run away
      from her husband in my house, and the husband never be warned of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised her,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What care I for your promises?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I will tell him, so that he
      may yet go after her and bring her back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not,&rdquo; he insisted, gripping her more closely. But at that
      moment a delicately mocking voice greeted their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry, 'tis vastly diverting to hear you,&rdquo; it said. They looked round, to
      find one of the party of town sparks that had halted at the inn standing
      arms akimbo in the narrow passage, clearly waiting for them to make room.
      &ldquo;A touching sight, sir,&rdquo; said he sardonically to the landlord. &ldquo;A wondrous
      touching sight to behold a man of your years playing the turtle-dove to
      his good wife like the merest fledgeling. It grieves me to intrude myself
      so harshly upon your cooing, though if you'll but let me pass you may
      resume your chaste embrace without uneasiness, for I give you my word I'll
      never look behind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abashed, the landlord and his dame fell apart. Then, ere the gentleman
      could pass her, Mistress Quinn, like a true opportunist, sped swiftly down
      the passage and into the common room before her husband could again detain
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, within the common room of the Suffolk Arms Sir Crispin sat face to
      face with a very pretty fellow, all musk and ribbons, and surrounded by
      some half-dozen gentlemen on their way to London who had halted to rest at
      Stafford.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pretty gentleman swore lustily, affected a monstrous wicked look,
      assured that he was impressing all who stood about with some conceit of
      the rakehelly ways he pursued in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      A game started with crowns to while away the tedium of the enforced
      sojourn at the inn had grown to monstrous proportions. Fortune had
      favoured the youth at first, but as the stakes grew her favours to him
      diminished, and at the moment that Cynthia rode out of the inn-yard, Mr.
      Harry Foster flung his last gold piece with an oath upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rat me,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;there's the end of a hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He toyed sorrowfully with the red ribbon in his black hair, and Crispin,
      seeing that no fresh stake was forthcoming, made shift to rise. But the
      coxcomb detained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tarry, sir,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I've not yet done. 'Slife, we'll make a night of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a ring from his finger, and with a superb gesture of disdain
      pushed it across the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll ye stake?&rdquo; And, in the same breath, &ldquo;Boy, another stoup,&rdquo; he
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crispin eyed the gem carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty Caroluses,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rat me, sir, that nose of yours proclaims you a jew, without more. Say
      twenty-five, and I'll cast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a tolerant smile, and the shrug of a man to whom twenty-five or a
      hundred are of like account, Crispin consented. They threw; Crispin passed
      and won.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll ye stake?&rdquo; cried Mr. Foster, and a second ring followed the
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Crispin could reply, the door leading to the interior of the inn
      was flung open, and Mrs. Quinn, breathless with exertion and excitement,
      came scurrying across the room. In the doorway stood the host in hesitancy
      and fear. Bending to Crispin's ear, Mrs. Quinn delivered her message in a
      whisper that was heard by most of those who were about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; cried Crispin in consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman pointed to her husband, and Crispin, understanding from this
      that she referred him to the host, called to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What know you, landlord?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Come hither, and tell me whither
      is she gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; replied the quaking host, adding the particulars of
      Cynthia's departure, and the information that the lady seemed in great
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saddle me a horse,&rdquo; cried Crispin, leaping to his feet, and pitching Mr.
      Foster's trinket upon the table as though it were a thing of no value.
      &ldquo;Towards Denham you say they rode? Quick, man!&rdquo; And as the host departed
      he swept the gold and the ring he had won into his pockets preparing to
      depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoity toity!&rdquo; cried Mr. Foster. &ldquo;What sudden haste is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, sir, that Fortune has been unkind to you, but I must go.
      Circumstances have arisen which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;n your circumstances!&rdquo; roared Foster, get ting on his feet.
      &ldquo;You'll not leave me thus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your permission, sir, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you shall not have my permission!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall be so unfortunate as to go without it. But I shall return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, 'tis an old legend, that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin turned about in despair. To be embroiled now might ruin
      everything, and by a miracle he kept his temper. He had a moment to spare
      while his horse was being saddled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you have upon your pretty person trinkets to half the
      value of what I have won from you, I'll stake the whole against them on
      one throw, after which, no matter what the result, I take my departure.
      Are you agreed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur of admiration from those present at the recklessness
      and the generosity of the proposal, and Foster was forced to accept it.
      Two more rings he drew forth, a diamond from the ruffles at his throat,
      and a pearl that he wore in his ear. The lot he set upon the board, and
      Crispin threw the winning cast as the host entered to say that his horse
      was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gathered the trinkets up, and with a polite word of regret he was gone,
      leaving Mr. Harry Foster to meditate upon the pledging of one of his
      horses to the landlord in discharge of his lodging.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it fell out that before Cynthia had gone six miles along the road
      to Denham, one of her attendants caught a rapid beat of hoofs behind them,
      and drew her attention to it, suggesting that they were being followed.
      Faster Cynthia bade them travel, but the pursuer gained upon them at every
      stride. Again the man drew her attention to it, and proposed that they
      should halt and face him who followed. The possession of the musketoon
      gave him confidence touching the issue. But Cynthia shuddered at the
      thought, and again, with promises of rich reward, urged them to go faster.
      Another mile they went, but every moment brought the pursuing hoof-beats
      nearer and nearer, until at last a hoarse challenge rang out behind them,
      and they knew that to go farther would be vain; within the next half-mile,
      ride as they might, their pursuer would be upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was moonless, yet sufficiently clear for objects to be perceived
      against the sky, and presently the black shadow of him who rode behind
      loomed up upon the road, not a hundred paces off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite Cynthia's orders not to fire, he of the musketoon raised his
      weapon under cover of the darkness and blazed at the approaching shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia cried out&mdash;a shriek of dismay it was; the horses plunged, and
      Sir Crispin laughed aloud as he bore down upon them. He of the musketoon
      heard the swish of a sword being drawn, and saw the glitter of the blade
      in the dark. A second later there was a shock as Crispin's horse dashed
      into his, and a crushing blow across the forehead, which Galliard
      delivered with the hilt of his rapier, sent him hurtling from the saddle.
      His comrade clapped spurs to his horse at that and was running a race with
      the night wind in the direction of Denham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Cynthia quite knew what had happened the seat on the pillion in
      front of her was empty, and she was riding back to Stafford with Crispin
      beside her, his hand upon the bridle of her horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little fool!&rdquo; he said half-angrily, half-gibingly; and thereafter
      they rode in silence&mdash;she too mortified with shame and anger to
      venture upon words.
    </p>
    <p>
      That journey back to Stafford was a speedy one, and soon they stood again
      in the inn-yard out of which she had ridden but an hour ago. Avoiding the
      common room, Crispin ushered her through the side door by which she had
      quitted the house. The landlord met them in the passage, and looking at
      Crispin's face the pallor and fierceness of it drove him back without a
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they ascended to the chamber where in solitude she had spent the
      day. Her feelings were those of a child caught in an act of disobedience,
      and she was angry with herself and her weakness that it should be so. Yet
      within the room she stood with bent head, never glancing at her companion,
      in whose eyes there was a look of blended anger and amazement as he
      observed her. At length in calm, level tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you run away?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was to her anger as a gust of wind to a smouldering fire. She
      threw back her head defiantly, and fixed him with a glance as fierce as
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; she cried, and suddenly stopped short. The fire died
      from her eyes, and they grew wide in wonder&mdash;in fascinated wonder&mdash;to
      see a deep stain overspreading one side of his grey doublet, from the left
      shoulder downwards. Her wonder turned to horror as she realized the nature
      of that stain and remembered that one of her men had fired upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wounded?&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sickly smile came into his face, and seemed to accentuate its pallor. He
      made a deprecatory gesture. Then, as if in that gesture he had expended
      his last grain of strength, he swayed suddenly as he stood. He made as if
      to reach a chair, but at the second step he stumbled, and without further
      warning he fell prone at her feet, his left hand upon his heart, his right
      outstretched straight from the shoulder. The loss of blood he had
      sustained, following upon the fatigue and sleeplessness that had been his
      of late, had demanded its due from him, man of iron though he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the instant her anger vanished. A great fear that he was dead
      descended upon her, and to heighten the horror of it came the thought that
      he had received his death-wound through her agency. With a moan of anguish
      she went down upon her knees beside him. She raised his head and pillowed
      it in her lap, calling to him by name, as though her voice alone must
      suffice to bring him back to life and consciousness. Instinctively she
      unfastened his doublet at the neck, and sought to draw it away that she
      might see the nature of his hurt and staunch the wound if possible, but
      her strength ebbed away from her, and she abandoned her task, unable to do
      more than murmur his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crispin, Crispin, Crispin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stooped and kissed the white, clammy forehead, then his lips, and as
      she did so a tremor ran through her, and he opened his eyes. A moment they
      looked dull and lifeless, then they waxed questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second ago these two had stood in anger with the width of the room
      betwixt them; now, in a flash, he found his head on her lap, her lips on
      his. How came he there? What meant it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crispin, Crispin,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;thank God you did but swoon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the awakening of his soul came swift upon the awakening of his body.
      He lay there, oblivious of his wound, oblivious of his mission, oblivious
      of his son. He lay with senses still half dormant and comprehension
      dulled, but with a soul alert he lay, and was supremely happy with a
      happiness such as he had never known in all his ill-starred life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a feeble voice he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you run away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us forget it,&rdquo; she answered softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay&mdash;tell me first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered; then, gathering courage,
      &ldquo;I thought you did not really care, that you made a toy of me,&rdquo; said she.
      &ldquo;When they told me that you sat at dice with a gentleman from London I was
      angry at your neglect. If you loved me, I told myself, you would not have
      used me so, and left me to mope alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Crispin let his grey eyes devour her blushing face. Then he
      closed them and pondered what she had said, realization breaking upon him
      now like a great flood. The light came to him in one blinding yet
      all-illuming flash. A hundred things that had puzzled him in the last two
      days grew of a sudden clear, and filled him with a joy unspeakable. He
      dared scarce believe that he was awake, and Cynthia by him&mdash;that he
      had indeed heard aright what she had said. How blind he had been, how
      nescient of himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as his thoughts travelled on to the source of the misapprehension he
      remembered his son, and the memory was like an icy hand upon his temples
      that chilled him through and through. Lying there with eyes still closed
      he groaned. Happiness was within his grasp at last. Love might be his
      again did he but ask it, and the love of as pure and sweet a creature as
      ever God sent to chasten a man's life. A great tenderness possessed him. A
      burning temptation to cast to the winds his plighted word, to make a mock
      of faith, to deride honour, and to seize this woman for his own. She loved
      him he knew it now; he loved her&mdash;the knowledge had come as suddenly
      upon him. Compared with this what could his faith, his word, his honour
      give him? What to him, in the face of this, was that paltry fellow, his
      son, who had spurned him!
    </p>
    <p>
      The hardest fight he ever fought, he fought it there, lying supine upon
      the ground, his head in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he fought it out with closed eyes, perchance honour and his plighted
      word had won the day; but he opened them, and they met Cynthia's.
    </p>
    <p>
      A while they stayed thus; the hungry glance of his grey eyes peering into
      the clear blue depths of hers; and in those depths his soul was drowned,
      his honour stifled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;God pity me, I love you!&rdquo; And he swooned again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. TO FRANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      That cry, which she but half understood, was still ringing in her ears,
      when the door was of a sudden flung open, and across the threshold a very
      daintily arrayed young gentleman stepped briskly, the expostulating
      landlord following close upon his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell thee, lying dog,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I saw him ride into the yard, and,
      'fore George, he shall give me the chance of mending my losses. Be off to
      your father, you Devil's natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia looked up in alarm, whereupon that merry blood catching sight of
      her, halted in some confusion at what he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rat me, madam,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I did not know&mdash;I had not looked to&mdash;&rdquo;
       He stopped, and remembering at last his manners he made her a low bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your servant, madam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your servant Harry Foster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him, her eyes full of inquiry, but said nothing, whereat the
      pretty gentleman plucked awkwardly at his ruffles and wished himself
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know, madam, that your husband was hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not my husband, sir,&rdquo; she answered, scarce knowing what she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gadso!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;Yet you ran away from him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her cheeks grew crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door, sir, is behind you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, madam, is that thief the landlord,&rdquo; he made answer, no whit abashed.
      &ldquo;Come hither, you bladder of fat, the gentleman is hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus courteously summoned, the landlord shuffled forward, and Mr. Foster
      begged Cynthia to allow him with the fellow's aid to see to the
      gentleman's wound. Between them they laid Crispin on a couch, and the town
      spark went to work with a dexterity little to have been expected from his
      flippant exterior. He dressed the wound, which was in the shoulder and not
      in itself of a dangerous character, the loss of blood it being that had
      brought some gravity to the knight's condition. They propped his head upon
      a pillow, and presently he sighed and, opening his eyes, complained of
      thirst, and was manifestly surprised at seeing the coxcomb turned leech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came in search of you to pursue our game,&rdquo; Foster explained when they
      had ministered to him, &ldquo;and, 'fore George, I am vastly grieved to find you
      in this condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pish, sir, my condition is none so grievous&mdash;a scratch, no more, and
      were my heart itself pierced the knowledge that I have gained&mdash;&rdquo; He
      stopped short. &ldquo;But there, sir,&rdquo; he added presently, &ldquo;I am grateful beyond
      words for your timely ministration, and if to my debt you will add that of
      leaving me awhile to rest, I shall appreciate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His glance met Cynthia's and he smiled. The host coughed significantly,
      and shuffled towards the door. But Master Foster made no shift to move;
      but stood instead beside Galliard, though in apparent hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like a word with you ere I go,&rdquo; he said at length. Then turning
      and perceiving the landlord standing by the door in an attitude of
      eloquent waiting: &ldquo;Take yourself off,&rdquo; he cried to him. &ldquo;Crush me, may not
      one gentleman say a word to another without being forced to speak into
      your inquisitive ears as well? You will forgive my heat, madam, but, God
      a'mercy, that greasy rascal tries me sorely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; he resumed, when the host was gone. &ldquo;I stand thus: I have lost
      to you to-day a sum of money which, though some might account
      considerable, is in itself no more than a trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, however, greatly exercised at the loss of certain trinkets which
      have to me a peculiar value, and which, to be frank, I staked in a moment
      of desperation. I had hoped, sir, to retrieve my losses o'er a friendly
      main this evening, for I have still to stake a coach and four horses&mdash;as
      noble a set of beasts as you'll find in England, aye rat me. Your wound,
      sir, renders it impossible for me to ask you to give yourself the fatigue
      of obliging me. I come, then, to propose that you return me those trinkets
      against my note of hand for the amount that was staked on them. I am well
      known in town, sir,&rdquo; he added hurriedly, &ldquo;and you need have no anxiety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin stopped him with a wave of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none, sir, in that connexion, and I am willing to do as you
      suggest.&rdquo; He thrust his hand into his pocket, and drew forth the rings,
      the brooch and the ear-ring he had won. &ldquo;Here, sir, are your trinkets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried Mr. Foster, thrown into some confusion by Galliard's
      unquestioning generosity, &ldquo;I am indebted to you. Rat me, sir, I am indeed.
      You shall have my note of hand on the instant. How much shall we say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Mr. Foster,&rdquo; said Crispin, an idea suddenly occurring to him.
      &ldquo;You mentioned horses. Are they fresh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As June roses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are returning to London, are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you wish to proceed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, sir, I have a proposal to make which will remove the need of
      your note of hand. Lend me your horses, sir, to reach Harwich. I wish to
      set out at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your wound?&rdquo; cried Cynthia. &ldquo;You are still faint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faint! Not I. I am awake and strong. My wound is no wound, for a scratch
      may not be given that name. So there, sweetheart.&rdquo; He laughed, and drawing
      down her head, he whispered the words: &ldquo;Your father.&rdquo; Then turning again
      to Foster. &ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there are four tolerable posthorses
      of mine below, on which you can follow tomorrow to Harwich, there
      exchanging them again for your own, which you shall find awaiting you,
      stabled at the Garter Inn. For this service, to me of immeasurable value,
      I will willingly cede those gewgaws to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, rat me, sir,&rdquo; cried Foster in bewilderment, &ldquo;tis too generous&mdash;'pon
      honour it is. I can't consent to it. No, rat me, I can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you how great a boon you will confer. Believe me, sir, to me
      it is worth twice, a hundred times the value of those trinkets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have my horses, sir, and my note of hand as well,&rdquo; said Foster
      firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your note of hand is of no value to me, sir. I look to leave England
      to-morrow, and I know not when I may return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus in the end it came about that the bargain was concluded. Cynthia's
      maid was awakened and bidden to rise. The horses were harnessed to
      Crispin's coach, and Crispin, leaning upon Harry Foster's arm, descended
      and took his place within the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the London blood at the door of the Suffolk Arms, crushing,
      burning, damning and ratting himself at Crispin's magnificence, they
      rolled away through the night in the direction of Ipswich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten o'clock in the morning beheld them at the door of the Garter Inn at
      Harwich. But the jolting of the coach had so hardly used Crispin that he
      had to be carried into the hostelry. He was much exercised touching the
      Lady Jane and his inability to go down to the quay in quest of her, when
      he was accosted by a burly, red-faced individual who bluntly asked him was
      he called Sir Crispin Galliard. Ere he could frame an answer the man had
      added that he was Thomas Jackson, master of the Lady Jane&mdash;at which
      piece of good news Crispin felt like to shout for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his reflection upon his present position, when at last he lay in the
      schooner's cabin, brought him the bitter reverse of pleasure. He had set
      out to bring Cynthia to his son; he had pledged his honour to accomplish
      it. How was he fulfilling his trust? In his despondency, during a moment
      when alone, he cursed the knave that had wounded him for his clumsiness in
      not having taken a lower aim when he fired, and thus solved him this ugly
      riddle of life for all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vainly did he strive to console himself and endeavour to palliate the
      wrong he had done with the consideration that he was the man Cynthia
      loved, and not his son; that his son was nothing to her, and that she
      would never have accompanied him had she dreamt that he wooed her for
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. The deed was foul, and rendered fouler still by virtue of those other
      wrongs in whose extenuation it had been undertaken. For a moment he grew
      almost a coward. He was on the point of bidding Master Jackson avoid
      Calais and make some other port along the coast. But in a moment he had
      scorned the craven argument of flight, and determined that come what might
      he would face his son, and lay the truth before him, leaving him to judge
      how strong fate had been. As he lay feverish and fretful in the vessel's
      cabin, he came well-nigh to hating Kenneth; he remembered him only as a
      poor, mean creature, now a bigot, now a fop, now a psalm-monger, now a
      roysterer, but ever a hypocrite, ever a coward, and never such a man as he
      could have taken pride in presenting as his offspring.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a fair wind, and towards evening Cynthia, who had been absent
      from his side a little while, came to tell him that the coast of France
      grew nigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      His answer was a sigh, and when she chid him for it, he essayed a smile
      that was yet more melancholy. For a second he was tempted to confide in
      her; to tell her of the position in which he found himself and to lighten
      his load by sharing it with her. But this he dared not do. Cynthia must
      never know.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. THE AUBERGE DU SOLEIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a room of the first floor of the Auberge du Soleil, at Calais, the host
      inquired of Crispin if he were milord Galliard. At that question Crispin
      caught his breath in apprehension, and felt himself turn pale. What it
      portended, he guessed; and it stifled the hope that had been rising in him
      since his arrival, and because he had not found his son awaiting him
      either on the jetty or at the inn. He dared ask no questions, fearing that
      the reply would quench that hope, which rose despite himself, and begotten
      of a desire of which he was hardly conscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed before replying, and passing his brown, nervous hand across his
      brow, he found it moist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name, M. l'hote, is Crispin Galliard. What news have you for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman&mdash;a countryman of milord's&mdash;has been here these
      three days awaiting him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a little while Crispin sat quite still, stripped of his last rag of
      hope. Then suddenly bracing himself, he sprang up, despite his weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring him to me. I will see him at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tout-a-l'heure, monsieur,&rdquo; replied the landlord. &ldquo;At the moment he is
      absent. He went out to take the air a couple of hours ago, and is not yet
      returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven send he has walked into the sea!&rdquo; Crispin broke out passionately.
      Then as passionately he checked himself. &ldquo;No, no, my God&mdash;not that! I
      meant not that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur will sup?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once, and let me have lights.&rdquo; The host withdrew, to return a moment
      later with a couple of lighted tapers, which he set upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was retiring, a heavy step sounded on the stair, accompanied by the
      clank of a scabbard against the baluster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes milord's countryman,&rdquo; the landlord announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Crispin, looking up in apprehension, saw framed in the doorway the
      burly form of Harry Hogan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat bolt upright, staring as though he beheld an apparition. With a sad
      smile, Hogan advanced, and set his hand affectionately upon Galliard's
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome to France, Crispin,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If not him whom you looked to
      find, you have at least a loyal friend to greet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogan!&rdquo; gasped the knight. &ldquo;What make you here? How came you here? Where
      is Jocelyn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Irishman looked at him gravely for a moment, then sighed and sank down
      upon a chair. &ldquo;You have brought the lady?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is here. She will be with us presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan groaned and shook his grey head sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where is Jocelyn?&rdquo; cried Galliard again, and his haggard face looked
      very wan and white as he turned it inquiringly upon his companion. &ldquo;Why is
      he not here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have bad news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad news?&rdquo; muttered Crispin, as though he understood not the meaning of
      the words. &ldquo;Bad news?&rdquo; he repeated musingly. Then bracing himself, &ldquo;What
      is this news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have brought the lady too!&rdquo; Hogan complained. &ldquo;Faith, I had hoped
      that you had failed in that at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sdeath, Harry,&rdquo; Crispin exclaimed. &ldquo;Will you tell me the news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan pondered a moment. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will relate the story from the very beginning,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Some four
      hours after your departure from Waltham) my men brought in the malignant
      we were hunting. I dispatched my sergeant and the troop forthwith to
      London with the prisoner, keeping just two troopers with me. An hour or so
      later a coach clattered into the yard, and out of it stepped a short, lean
      man in black, with a very evil face and a crooked eye, who bawled out that
      he was Joseph Ashburn of Castle Marleigh, a friend of the Lord General's,
      and that he must have horses on the instant to proceed upon his journey to
      London. I was in the yard at the time, and hearing the full announcement I
      guessed what his business in London was. He entered the inn to refresh
      himself and I followed him. In the common room the first man his eyes
      lighted on was your son. He gasped at sight of him, and when he had
      recovered his breath he let fly as round a volley of blasphemy as ever I
      heard from the lips of a Puritan. When that was over, &ldquo;Fool,&rdquo; he yells,
      &ldquo;what make you here?&rdquo; The lad stammered and grew confused. At last&mdash;&ldquo;I
      was detained here,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Detained!&rdquo; thunders the other, &ldquo;and by
      whom?&rdquo; &ldquo;By my father, you murdering villain!&rdquo; was the hot answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that Master Ashburn grows very white and very evil-looking. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he
      says, in a playful voice, &ldquo;you have learnt that, have you? Well, by God!
      the lesson shall profit neither you nor that rascal your father. But I'll
      begin with you, you cur.&rdquo; And with that he seizes a jug of ale that stood
      on the table, and empties it over the boy's face. Soul of my body! The lad
      showed such spirit then as I had never looked to find in him. &ldquo;Outside,&rdquo;
       yells he, tugging at his sword with one hand, and pointing to the door
      with the other. &ldquo;Outside, you hound, where I can kill you!&rdquo; Ashburn
      laughed and cursed him, and together they flung past me into the yard. The
      place was empty at the moment, and there, before the clash of their blades
      had drawn interference, the thing was over&mdash;and Ashburn had sent his
      sword through Jocelyn's heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan paused, and Crispin sat very still and white, his soul in torment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Ashburn?&rdquo; he asked presently, in a voice that was singularly hoarse
      and low. &ldquo;What became of him? Was he not arrested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hogan grimly, &ldquo;he was not arrested. He was buried. Before he
      had wiped his blade I had stepped up to him and accused him of murdering a
      beardless boy. I remembered the reckoning he owed you, I remembered that
      he had sought to send you to your death; I saw the boy's body still warm
      and bleeding upon the ground, and I struck him with my knuckles on the
      mouth. Like the cowardly ruffian he was, he made a pass at me with his
      sword before I had got mine out. I avoided it narrowly, and we set to
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People rushed in and would have stopped us, but I cursed them so whilst I
      fenced, swearing to kill any man that came between us, that they held off
      and waited. I didn't keep them overlong. I was no raw youngster fresh from
      the hills of Scotland. I put the point of my sword through Joseph
      Ashburn's throat within a minute of our engaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was then as I stood in that shambles and looked down upon my handiwork
      that I recalled in what favour Master Ashburn was held by the Parliament,
      and I grew sick to think of what the consequences might be. To avoid them
      I got me there and then to horse, and rode in a straight line for
      Greenwich, hoping to find the Lady Jane still there. But my messenger had
      already sent her to Harwich for you. I was well ahead of possible pursuit,
      and so I pushed on to Dover, and thence I crossed, arriving here three
      days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crispin rose and stepped up to Hogan. &ldquo;The last time you came to me after
      killing a man, Harry, I was of some service to you. You shall find me no
      less useful now. You will come to Paris with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the lady?&rdquo; gasped Hogan, amazed at Crispin's lack of thought for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear her step upon the stairs. Leave me now, Harry, but as you go,
      desire the landlord to send for a priest. The lady remains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One look of utter bewilderment did Hogan bestow upon Sir Crispin, and for
      once his glib, Irish tongue could shape no other words than:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soul of my body!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrung Crispin's hand, and in a state of ineffable perplexity he hurried
      from the room to do what was required of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Crispin stood by the window, and looking out into the night
      he thanked God from his heart for his solution of the monstrous riddle
      that had been set him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the rustle of a gown drew his attention, and he swung round to find
      Cynthia smiling upon him from the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He advanced to meet her, and setting his hands upon her shoulders, he held
      her at arm's length, looking down into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia, my Cynthia!&rdquo; he cried. And she, breaking past the barrier of his
      grasp, nestled up to him with a sigh of sweet and unalloyed content.
    </p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
