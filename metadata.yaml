description: Take a trip to the distant past with this majestic epic from Rafael Sabatini,
  regarded as one of the masters of the historical action-adventure genre. Set in
  the times of knights, maidens, and castles, The Tavern Knight follows the fortunes
  of a gallant nobleman who has had his fortune and property stripped by evil agents
  of the king. Left with nothing to call his own, he concocts a complex plot to get
  his revenge.
